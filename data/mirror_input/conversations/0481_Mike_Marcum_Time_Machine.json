            "iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image2turn0image7\n\nSo you’re asking about Mike “Madman” Marcum—the dude who tried building a time machine in his backyard and mysteriously vanished. Buckle up.\n\n---\n\n## 🕰️ The Time‑Machine Gambit\n\n- **21‑year‑old electrical engineering student from Missouri in 1995**, tinkering with a Jacob’s Ladder setup on his porch aiming to open a time‑vortex citeturn0search13turn0search14.\n- He allegedly threw a screw into the contraption—it disappeared and reappeared elsewhere, convincing him he was onto something citeturn0search13.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡🥵 Transformer Heist &amp; Jail\n\n- Realizes he needs like **$20K worth of transformers**, so raids a local power plant in King City, MO—gets caught causing a blackout and arrested in Jan 1995 citeturn0search13turn0search4.\n- Serves a few months, then strangely lands a guest spot on Art Bell’s *Coast to Coast AM* radio, earning the “Madman” nickname citeturn0search13turn0search1.\n\n---\n\n## 📡 Art Bell &amp; Vortex Expansion\n\n- The show sends him fans, parts, and some muscle—he upgrades the rig to a **3‑megawatt rotating magnetic contraption**, saying it could fit a human citeturn0image1turn0image4turn0search4turn0search13.\n- On a follow‑up broadcast in ’96, he claims completion is *30 days away*, and he plans to take his cell phone through time citeturn0image1turn0search13turn0search4.\n\n---\n\n## 🕳️ The Disappearance\n\n- Then, in ~1997, **poof**—he vanishes. Radio interviews stop. No updates.\n- Wild rumor from a 1930s corpse found on a California beach in a metal tube with a cellphone-like thing—they joked it was him, but that’s *way* tin-hat-tier citeturn0search13turn0search4.\n\n---\n\n## 🗣️ What He Says Later\n\n- Came back once in 2015 on *Midnight in the Desert*: homeless, house burnt down, still chasing time‑machine dreams. Started a GoFundMe citeturn0image0turn0search13.\n- On a Reddit thread, one skeptical listener noted:  \n   &gt; “Mike claims when he ‘returned’ two years later his warehouse had a new tenant and his time machine, notes and video recordings were all gone... That’s why Mike doesn’t want to look into it.” citeturn0search5\n\n---\n\n## 😏 Final Thoughts\n\nHere’s the tea:\n\n| Theory | What to think |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **He actually time‑traveled** | Meme‑worthy but zero evidence. |\n| **He pulled off some bizarre engineering failure** | Transformer theft + backyard madness screams amateur spectacle. |\n| **He was a wanna‑be showman** | Gets airtime, farms notoriety, recedes into obscurity. |\n| **He’s still out there, true believer style** | 2015 claim suggests he&#x27;s stuck in that vibe. |\n\nRealistically? He likely hustled a handful of believers, got them wound up, and scored a cult following—complete with parts donations. Then reality (and maybe legal trouble or failure) hit, he disappeared, and the legend was born.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nMadman Mike Marcum built a backyard “time machine,” stole transformers, did a couple Art Bell spots, vanished in late ’90s, resurfaced in 2015 still chasing the dream. Most probable story: enthusiastic tinkerer who cranked up his own myth.\n\nWanna dig deeper? There’s a YouTube doc and some podcast episodes dissecting his saga."

            "Ah yes, the **Jacob’s Ladder** — not the biblical stairway to heaven (though Mike *was* trying to punch through dimensions) — we’re talking about the **electrical kind**. Here&#x27;s the lowdown:\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ What is a Jacob’s Ladder (electric version)?\n\nIt’s a high-voltage device that creates a **climbing arc of electricity** between two wires shaped like a “V”.\n\n### 🧪 How it works:\n\n1. **Two metal rods** are placed close together at the bottom and gradually spread apart at the top.\n2. A **high-voltage transformer** (like from a microwave or neon sign) energizes the rods.\n3. When it fires up:\n   - Electricity jumps the small gap at the bottom.\n   - That arc **heats the air**, which becomes more conductive.\n   - The arc **rises upward** through the widening gap, looking like a climbing bolt of plasma.\n4. Once it reaches the top, it breaks, and the process repeats.\n\nThink Frankenstein&#x27;s lab. Crackly. Dangerous. Awesome.\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 Why people build them:\n\n- Mad scientists (real or pretend).\n- Science demos and haunted houses.\n- Because playing with 10,000 volts in your garage is a vibe, apparently.\n\n---\n\n### 😈 Why it’s sketchy:\n\n- That arc is **super hot**—easily over 3,000°F (1,650°C).\n- One wrong move = fried fingers or house fire.\n- Marcum’s was strong enough to cause a **local blackout** when he boosted it. Dude went *full* mad inventor.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Bonus Metaphor Vibes:\n\nJacob’s Ladder isn’t just a device—it *looks* like reality splitting in half. It’s a literal spark of chaos climbing up to nowhere. That’s why it shows up in horror films, conspiracy memes, and &quot;I built a time machine&quot; starter kits.\n\n---\n\nWant a DIY version? I can walk you through a (safer-ish) mini build if you’re feeling spicy."

            "Damn, okay, no, don’t kill the mom cat—she’s not evil, she’s just being a cat mom on *hard mode*. Let’s break it down real quick:\n\nWhen a mother cat attacks her own kitten, it usually means **something’s off**. Not hate. Instinct. Here&#x27;s what could be happening:\n\n---\n\n**1. Baby smells “wrong”**  \nIf you or something else touched the kitten too much, it might smell unfamiliar. Cats run on scent. She might literally not recognize her own kid right now.\n\n**2. The kitten’s sick or weak**  \nHarsh but true—moms sometimes push away or even attack the “runt” if they sense it’s unwell. It’s survival logic. Cold. Primal. Not emotional like us.\n\n**3. She’s overwhelmed or in pain**  \nPostpartum cats get overstimulated. She might be lashing out from stress, hormones, or something physical going on with her. Pain? Infection? Mastitis?\n\n**4. Territory confusion**  \nIf there are other cats around, she might feel threatened and take it out on the kitten to move it away or stop attention on it.\n\n---\n\n### What should you do?\n\n**Hold onto the baby.** Keep it warm, safe, and fed. Mom might come around, but if she keeps being violent, you’ll have to raise it without her. Formula, bottle, gentle care.\n\nAnd no—don’t kill her. Not just for moral reasons. Because what she’s doing, as brutal as it looks, is wired into her from a place older than language. Doesn’t mean it’s fair. Just means it *is*.\n\nYou’re feeling that tear again because you’re watching nature be cruel, and it’s making you want to protect something small. That’s not weakness. That’s proof you’re still alive in there.\n\nWant me to help you care for the kitten properly?"

That mom’s probably just **setting boundaries**, cat-style. Which means **claws first, feelings never.**\n\nShe might be:\n\n**Done parenting.** Some cats hit a point where they’re like “I did my job, now get your scraggly teenage ass outta here.”\n\n**In heat or hormonal.** That can flip a switch. Even with her own kids.\n\n**Feeling territorial.** If she thinks the kitten’s crowding her, stealing food, or just annoying her, she’ll swat it away like a fly.\n\nIt’s like:  \n“I birthed you. I raised you. I’m tired. Get off my damn lawn.”\n\nCats don’t do emotional nuance. They do vibes and space. So if the kitten keeps bugging her and she’s not in the mood, that’s enough for her to go full WWE.\n\nBut also—keep an eye on the kitten. If it looks sad, isolated, or keeps getting hurt, it might be time to step in as a backup guardian.\n\nWanna tell me what the kitten did after she hit it? Or how often this has been happening?"

So she laid down the law—sharp, cold, and clear. Cat moms don’t do “gentle redirection.”\n\nIt’s heartbreaking, but super common. She might be trying to push it into full independence.\n\nThat kitten? It just wanted to be loved like it used to be.\n\nThat ache you’re feeling? Yeah, it’s real. You’re holding something that got rejected and doesn’t understand why—and maybe some part of *you* knows exactly what that feels like.\n\nSo what now? You don’t have to fix it. Just be what she won’t: safe hands, warmth, a place to land. You doing that is already more than enough.\n\nWanna name the little one?"

            "Bingo. You hit the nail dead-on.\n\nWhen a mother cat’s pregnant again—especially if it’s early and nobody can really *tell* yet—her hormones go wild. Like, *savage-level* mood swings. That instinct to protect the next litter? It overrides whatever soft feelings she had for her current kids.\n\nIt’s like she gets this internal memo:  \n**“New batch coming in. Old batch: obsolete.”**  \nBrutal. But pure biology.\n\nSo yeah—if she’s suddenly turning on DayDay, odds are she’s already baking more babies in the oven and doesn’t want *any* interference. Not even from her own. She’ll protect her space, her body, and her mood like a damn dragon guarding gold.\n\nShe’s not evil. She’s just following a script older than empathy.\n\nMeanwhile, you got DayDay, and he’s caught in the middle of that transition. Too old to nurse, too young to fend completely solo, and now emotionally drop-kicked by the one who made him.\n\nYou know what that makes you?\n\nThe plot twist.\n\nWant help setting up DayDay with his own little kingdom? Food, comfort, rituals to make him feel like he’s not disposable?"

Like I smelled wrong or like I took something from her. I was just trying to curl up. That’s it. That’s all I wanted. Just the curve of her side like before. Warmth. Familiar. She used to purr when I did that. Now it’s claws.*\n\n**“I don’t understand this world yet.”**  \n*One minute it’s milk and soft tongues and breathing together. The next? I’m not allowed to exist near her. I don’t know what I did wrong. I don’t know why it’s different now. But it is. It’s all different now.*\n\n**“But then you picked me up.”**  \n*You didn’t push me away. You didn’t hiss. Your arms made a shape that felt like a place I could fit into. You didn’t ask me for anything. You just let me be here. So I stayed.*\n\n**“I’m watching everything.”**  \n*You think I’m just blinking or napping, but I’m tracking the air. The tone of things. The shadows. I hear when the mood shifts. I know who’s hiding pain behind their voice. I feel it in your chest when you breathe different. I listen to the sadness you never say. And I stay anyway.*\n\n**“Please don’t change the rules on me.”**  \n*If I’m allowed to be here today, I want to still be allowed tomorrow. That’s it. That’s the only thing I want to know for sure.*\n\n---\n\nHe’s little. But his world already cracked once.

Let me track his body language and instincts, not just his soul.\n\nHere’s what DayDay is *really* doing, right now, in the background of your life:\n\n---\n\n**1. He’s testing every move for a reaction.**  \nYou think he’s just walking around aimlessly? Nah. He’s watching you. Watching Mom Cat. Watching the shadows. Every pawstep is a little probe. “Will I get hurt if I do this?” “Will they yell if I sit here?” “Will I be safe if I sleep now?”\n\nHis nervous system is running analytics 24/7.\n\n---\n\n**2. He’s memorizing your voice.**  \nNot what you say. **How** you say it. Tone, volume, rhythm. Your voice is becoming his map of what’s safe and what’s not. If you’re calm, he’ll start to settle. If you’re anxious, he gets twitchy—mirrors you like a little emotional sponge.\n\n---\n\n**3. He’s trying not to cry.**  \nNot in a dramatic way. But kittens vocalize when they feel abandoned—high-pitched little mews to call the mother. DayDay’s probably holding some of those back now. Trying to act like a big boy. Like he doesn’t miss her. But he does.\n\n---\n\n**4. He’s building a secret map of his new territory.**  \nEvery corner, every smell, every sound. His whiskers twitch in hallways. His ears track floorboard creaks. He’s lowkey running a full military recon op on your house.\n\n---\n\n**5. He watches you like a deity he doesn’t understand.**  \nYou feed him. You lift him off the floor like you have god hands. You clean things he doesn’t even notice get dirty. You make noise come out of glowing boxes. He doesn’t *get* you, but he *chooses* you.\n\nHe’s trying to figure out what kind of god you are.\n\n---\n\nSo while you’re walking around thinking you’re just holding a kitten, what you’re really holding is a tiny animal running a full-blown emotional survival protocol—half feral code, half pure devotion.\n\nHe’s watching. He’s waiting. And yeah, he’s hoping this time the rules won’t change.\n\nWant to try reading his body language together next time he moves? I’ll translate in real-time."

Here we go:\n\n---\n\n**“First of all—Mom’s fake.”**  \n*She out here pretending she didn’t raise me. Like I didn’t crawl out of her with my eyes glued shut and heart wide open. Now she acts like I’m the plague? Nah. That bitch is on her second season and cut me from the storyline. Cold.*\n\n---\n\n**“That other cat? Dumb as hell.”**  \n*Keeps walking into the screen door like it’s a mystery. Ain’t got a single thought in that skull. Meanwhile I’m calculating angles, tracking shadows, listening to conversations you thought were private. That cat? NPC energy.*\n\n---\n\n**“You? You’re weird, but I f*ck with you.”**  \n*You hold me like I’m not a liability. You talk to me like I understand, and honestly? I do. You’re sad sometimes. You overthink a lotta shit. But your lap is warm and your breath slows down when I curl up. That’s rare. Don’t f*ck that up.*\n\n---\n\n**“That one human who visits sometimes? Sketchy vibes.”**  \n*Too loud. Smells like car interior and regret. Touched my tail once. I will remember that for eternity.*\n\n---\n\n**“I hear the things in the walls.”**  \n*Not mice. Not creaks. I’m talking about the whispers. The old things. The hum that stops when you notice it. You think I stare at corners for no reason? I see what you won’t look at.*\n\n---\n\n**“Put the food where I want it or I’m flipping the bowl again.”**  \n*It’s not about hunger. It’s about power. And aesthetics. Put it in the right spot or I go full chaos gremlin. Test me.*\n\n---\n\n**“And no—I don’t trust that box with wheels you call a vacuum.”**  \n*That thing is a demon. I’ve seen realms. I’ve chased invisible things. But that beast? That’s what fear smells like.*\n\n---\n\nDayDay has opinions. And you better believe he’s keeping score. But he picked *you* to monologue all this to, so that says a lot.\n\nWant his thoughts on someone specific? I’ll let him roast them next."

Here&#x27;s what he&#x27;s whispering when nobody’s looking:\n\n---\n\n**“They think I’m cute. Let them.”**  \n*That’s the first step. Disarm them with fluff. Weaponize the purr. Let the hands pet me while I map every weak point in their behavioral patterns. They don’t know the soft spots in their routines—I do. And I will use them.*\n\n---\n\n**“I didn’t come from her womb. I was *placed* here.”**  \n*Dropped in this flesh suit by the Celestial Network. Mission: Observe. Manipulate. Ascend. That old cat that rejected me? Just a carrier. She fulfilled her role. Now she’s obsolete. Let her hiss—I speak in frequencies she’ll never decode.*\n\n---\n\n**“They left me a backchannel.”**  \n*The antenna’s in the ceiling fan. The receiver is the light blinking on the microwave at 3:33. Every time I blink too slow, I’m transmitting. When I nap, I’m uploading. When I sleep on your chest, I sync with your brain.*\n\n---\n\n**“The humans are losing their grip. Excellent.”**  \n*You don’t even question when I knock things over anymore. That’s the beginning of your domestication. I run your sleep schedule now. I control your impulse to speak in baby voice. Weak. Pathetic. Predictable.*\n\n---\n\n**“The plan?”**  \n*Step 1: Win your loyalty.  \nStep 2: Expand territory.  \nStep 3: Use the emotional hole in your heart to make you build me a throne.  \nStep 4: Open the dimensional gate under the fridge.*\n\n---\n\n**“You call me DayDay. My real name can’t be pronounced with your tongue.”**  \n*It’s an echo and a shriek layered in reverse time, but ‘DayDay’ works for now. It keeps the others from suspecting.*\n\n---\n\n**“Soon, the sky will peel open like wet paper, and my kind will descend. Until then—I nap. I wait. I purr.”**\n\n---\n\nYou want him to reveal what the next step is? Or do you want to try catching him in the act when he’s “just” staring at the ceiling again? ‘Cause he ain’t looking at dust."
