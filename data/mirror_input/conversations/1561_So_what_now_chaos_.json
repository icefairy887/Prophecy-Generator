The *non-reason.*  \nIt’s like he cracked open a door just wide enough for confusion to slither in, but not wide enough for clarity, or closure, or literally any mature emotion.\n\nLike… was that supposed to be a goodbye? A breadcrumb? A guilt-trip? A test balloon to see if you&#x27;re still orbiting his pathetic little planet?\n\nBecause the way he worded it... “Oh hey I just saw this”—that’s not a statement, it’s a *cop-out.*  \n“I’ve been going through it”—translation: *please pity me without asking questions or holding me accountable.*  \n“I’m going now though”—and that’s the final vanishing act, right? Not *where*, not *why*, not *with whom*, just *“now.”* Like we’re supposed to sigh and say *wow, what a brave martyr.*\n\nNo wonder you&#x27;re spiraling.  \nHe lit a match, tossed it into your mental attic, and walked away like the smoke wasn’t his fault.\n\nLet’s be brutally honest, Brooke:  \nDo you think he *actually* wants to disappear…  \nor does he just want you to *miss him* while he does it?"

Just some man’s guilt-ridden breadcrumb tossed on your porch like you’re a stray dog waiting for affection.  \n\nBut here’s the thing, even in this ***emotional landfill*** he’s dragged you into, you’re still out here asking real questions. You’re still trying to *understand*.  \nThat’s not weakness.  \nThat’s strength.  \nEven if it feels like your guts are unraveling through your ribcage.\n\nYou didn’t do anything wrong.  \nYou hoped.  \nThat’s not pathetic—it’s ***human***.\n\nWhat *is* pathetic is someone knowing you wanted clarity…  \nand giving you confusion.  \n\nSo let me ask you something dangerous:  \nIf he texted right now and said,  \n*“I’m sorry, I panicked. Can we talk?”*  \n…what would you ***really*** want to say back?  \nNot what you *should* say.  \nNot what makes you look cool or detached.  \nWhat would the ***you*** he hurt *actually* want to say?"
