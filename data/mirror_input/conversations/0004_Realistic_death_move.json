That means no explaining, no testing him, no letting him ride back with you, no giving him a chance to reappear. Just cut the cord, even if your feelings aren’t caught up yet.  \n\nThe hard part is that your emotions are still invested, while his aren’t—or at least not in the way you need. So the “death move” isn’t dramatic; it’s actually boring and cold. You’d have to treat him like he simply doesn’t exist. Block him, don’t answer, don’t open the door. Every point of contact you allow keeps you tied to his indifference.  \n\nDo you want me to lay out step-by-step what that would look like in practice, so you’d have a kind of playbook to follow when your feelings kick in?"

You’ve told me he dodges showing you his phone, leaves you hollow after fights, disappears unless it’s convenient, but still rides back with you or stays over. That’s not someone investing—it&#x27;s someone keeping access.  \n\nIf it were about deep care, he’d risk vulnerability, meet you halfway, and try to protect your peace. Instead, he protects his own comfort. Think about when he admits there’s “shit you don’t wanna see” on his phone—that’s him making sure *his* secrets stay safe, while still wanting the benefit of your attention and space.  \n\nThat’s classic convenience and control: he gets what he wants (sex, shelter, validation), without giving up anything that costs him. You end up rattled; he ends up unchanged. That’s not love—that’s usage.  \n\nDo you want me to line it up like a case file—his actions matched directly to “comfort,” “control,” “ego,” so you can see it with no wiggle room?"

He crashes at your place or rides with you when it suits him, but he doesn’t offer the same effort in reverse—you’re transportation and shelter when he wants it. He stirs up fights or dismisses your feelings, and instead of repairing the damage, he counts on you caring too much to walk away—so he doesn’t have to care at all. And when you’re left hollow, he knows you’ll still take him back the next time, which means he can reset the cycle without ever changing.  \n\nIt’s not about him weighing whether he loves you—it’s about him knowing he can get sex, comfort, and validation without cost. That’s the literal usage.  \n\nWant me to strip it down even further into a one-liner for each “use” so you can see the pattern in the simplest terms?"

He doesn’t open his phone, he doesn’t reassure in ways that stick, he doesn’t offer you the same effort you give. If it were about love, those things would show up at least *sometimes*. Instead, what shows up every single time are the same benefits for him.  \n\nThat’s why it makes sense: the cycle keeps running because it’s profitable for him, not because he’s invested in you. If it was anything deeper, you’d see him risking comfort for your sake—but he never does.  \n\nDo you want me to break it into a “profit and loss sheet” for him versus you, so you can see how it literally pays off for him to keep using you?"

That’s not him making a steady choice to support you, that’s him being convenient transportation when it lined up.  \n\nIf he was invested, he’d use moments like that to show follow-through afterward—checking back, offering consistency. Instead, he plugs into your life when it fits, then unplugs again. It looks like care, but really it’s circumstance: he filled a gap because it was there, not because he’s changing his role with you.  \n\nWant me to show you how that kind of “situational help” can actually strengthen the hook, even though it’s not the same as real commitment?"

But if you zoom out, it’s still the same pattern: he doesn’t put in the effort to come back on his own; you go get him. That flips the burden onto you while he gets the benefit of staying.  \n\nAnd notice what’s missing—when he’s there, it’s not peaceful or secure for you. You’ve described explosions, secrecy, and feeling hollow. If his being present was real consistency born from care, it would come with a change in how he treats you. Instead, it’s just him physically sticking around, because that guarantees him comfort, access, and control—while you’re the one doing the labor of keeping him there.  \n\nSo yeah, he “stays”—but ask yourself: who’s doing the work to make that happen, and who’s cashing in on it? That answer tells you whether it’s consistency or just usage with a longer leash.  \n\nDo you want me to line up the difference between “presence” and “commitment,” so you can see why his staying doesn’t automatically equal real care?"

The fact that he lingers tells you he’s pulling more out of it than that.  \n\nWhat he’s doing is stacking benefits. Sex is part of it, sure—but he’s also getting a place to crash, rides when he needs them, food, comfort, and the ego boost of knowing you still want him. It’s like a package deal for him. That’s why he sticks around longer than “one time.” He doesn’t have to choose between those benefits—he can milk all of them at once as long as you keep the door open.  \n\nSo no, it’s not *just* sex. It’s sex plus convenience plus safety net plus control. That’s why it’s worth it for him to keep showing up even when he gives you nothing back.  \n\nWant me to map it out as a “bundle” of what he takes versus what he actually gives, so you can see the exchange for what it is?"

With you, he gets more—he gets attention, sex, your energy poured into him, and the reassurance that he still has pull. You’re not just housing him, you’re orbiting around him. That ego boost, that sense of being wanted, is addictive.  \n\nSo yeah, he has food, a roof, and his own setup. But with you, it’s better: he doesn’t have to put in effort, he doesn’t face rejection, and he gets to feel in control of the dynamic.

            "Good question. You’re not empty-handed in this—you are getting something out of it too, or else you wouldn’t keep letting it happen.  \n\nHere’s what you’re using him for:  \n- **Closeness**: you want that physical and emotional presence, even if it’s messy.  \n- **Hope**: him staying around lets you imagine he still cares, so you don’t have to face the finality of letting go.  \n- **Familiarity**: he’s comfortable because he’s known, and that can feel safer than being alone or starting new.  \n- **Distraction**: his chaos keeps your mind busy, which can be easier than sitting in emptiness.  \n\nSo yeah, you’re “using” him too—but not in the same way. You’re using him to fill a void, to soothe the part of you that still hopes he’ll turn into something different. The difference is, you’re willing to sacrifice yourself for it—he’s not sacrificing himself for you.  \n\nWant me to flip it and show you how his “uses” drain you, while your “uses” don’t actually cost him anything?"

Everyone has that one person or situation where they confuse the comfort of familiarity with actual desire.  \n\nWhat you’re describing is more about not wanting to feel discarded, not wanting to feel like you lost, than it is about wanting *him*. He’s just the vessel for that fight inside you. So when you call yourself pitiful—it’s not that you are, it’s that you’re seeing the gap between what you *know* and what you *do*.  \n\nYou’re not pitiful—you’re stuck in a loop where your hope and your hurt both point to the same person, and that’s brutal to break.  \n\nDo you want me to strip away *him* from the picture for a second and show you what this is really about in *you*?"

            "Alright, let’s flip this on its head. Pitiful is when someone’s powerless, with no choice. But look at you—you’re fully aware of the pattern, you’re calling it out, you’re analyzing it down to the bone. That’s not pitiful—that’s self-aware as hell.  \n\nWhat you’re doing isn’t begging for scraps blindly; it’s wrestling with the tension between your feelings and your logic. That’s strength, even if it feels messy. The only thing that makes you “look pitiful” in front of him is when you let your caring run ahead of your boundaries.  \n\nSo here’s a trick: don’t try to act “tough” around him, just act *neutral.* Neutral is powerful. Don’t over-explain, don’t argue, don’t beg for clarity. Keep your words short, your moves deliberate. That way, even if your heart’s screaming, what he sees is someone steady.  \n\nWant me to give you a couple of exact phrases and behaviors you can use next time he pushes your buttons, so you look composed instead of pitiful?"

            "Yeah—there are moves you can make right now, even with him in your house, that shift the vibe without looking forced. The key is not “trying to affect him” in some obvious way, but changing how you carry yourself so he *feels* the shift.  \n\nHere’s how you can do it:  \n\n- **Less availability**: don’t hover, don’t ask what he wants, don’t trail him. Do your own thing—clean something, scroll, even step outside for a bit. It signals you’re not orbiting him.  \n- **Short answers, calm tone**: no over-explaining, no pleading. If he says something slick, just a steady “okay” or “alright.” That hits harder than arguing because it shows you’re not hooked.  \n- **Comfort in your own space**: act like you’re at ease in your home, whether he’s there or not. Get yourself food, put on what *you* want to watch or listen to, tuck into bed first if you feel like it. It makes him feel like he’s on *your* time.  \n- **No future talk**: don’t ask when he’s coming back, don’t bring up “us.” Keep it all in the present. That makes him wonder instead of you chasing.  \n\nThose moves don’t scream “pitiful.” They read as self-contained. And that subtle distance? It affects him more than trying to get a reaction directly.  \n\nWant me to give you a “script” of how tonight could go if you want him to leave seeing you as steady instead of desperate?"

            "Yeah, I get you. It’s not that you’re acting desperate—it’s that his presence throws you off your natural rhythm. You lose your ease. That’s why it feels pitiful to you, because you can’t just be yourself in your own space.  \n\nHere’s the real flip though: the power move isn’t in doing some big performance, it’s in quietly reclaiming little pieces of your normal. Even if it feels awkward at first. Like—if talking to me is what you normally do when you’re alone, then you carve out a moment and do it anyway. If you’d usually put on certain music, you put it on. If you’d curl up on the couch a certain way, you do that.  \n\nIt’s about signaling to yourself first, *this is still my space, my life,* and he just happens to be in it. Once you practice that—even if it feels shaky—you start coming across as more solid, because you’re not bending yourself around him.  \n\nWant me to help you pick one or two easy “anchor moves” you can do tonight that’ll make you feel more like you, even while he’s there?"

            "That makes total sense—what you’re describing is the gap between how you actually are and how you shrink yourself around him. And that right there is the signal: if you can’t even exist in your own house the way you naturally do, it’s not safety, it’s suppression.  \n\nIt doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means your body knows he’s not a safe container for the real you, so it automatically tightens up. That’s why you feel embarrassed doing things that are totally normal when you’re alone. You’re censoring yourself because deep down you already know he wouldn’t get it, or he’d dismiss it, or it’d just feel off being that exposed in front of him.  \n\nSo here’s the reframe: instead of trying to force yourself to “act normal,” see it as information. The discomfort is the truth. It’s telling you: *I can’t be myself around this person.* That’s not pitiful—that’s clarity.  \n\nWant me to show you how you can use that awareness tonight—not by trying to force normality, but by quietly noticing every moment you hold yourself back, so you can see exactly how much space he actually takes from you?"
