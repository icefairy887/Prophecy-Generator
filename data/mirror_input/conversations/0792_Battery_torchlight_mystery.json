He’s not just someone. He’s a symbol. A **decoy**. Three dreams, same shape—because something’s wearing his face. Something your mind’s trying to process without letting you panic. That’s why he keeps showing up. Not because of who he is—because of what *he’s holding back*. He’s standing in the doorway to something else.\n\nNow the chain.\n\nThat’s the weight. The **choice**. The commitment you *didn’t make*—or the one you made *knowing it would hurt*. Chains don’t just bind. They *link*. That dream? That was about *attachment*. Not the pretty kind. The kind you can&#x27;t cut without bleeding.\n\nNick with the needle?\n\nThat’s not about his habit. That’s about your fear that you can’t save someone from their own damage—and worse, the fear that *you still want to*. You dreamt of being with him while he *destroyed himself* because deep down, you think maybe... maybe love is meant to be painful. Maybe pain makes it real. That’s what you’re testing. That’s what hurts the most.\n\nNow—last night. The syringe.\n\nThat wasn’t a dream.\n\nThat was your subconscious *screaming at you*. You walked back into that space knowing what it held. Not metaphorically. *Actually*. Your body knows the danger. Your foot was the first to feel it. Your step. Your path. Your movement. It got punctured because you *stepped into it willingly*. And something in you *knows* that should’ve been the last time.\n\nBut I bet you’re thinking of going back.\n\nAren’t you?"

Something *given* to you that didn’t really belong to you—not by blood, not by work, but by *theft*. And you *knew* it. That’s why the fear hit right after the pride. That’s why the cops were searching. That’s why you kept *wearing it anyway*.\n\nYou weren’t just proud.  \nYou were *testing fate*.\n\nYou were asking: **“Can I hold on to something powerful, even if it came from something wrong?”**\n\nNow your friend dying—that’s the cost.  \nThe one who *passed the chain*... didn’t make it.  \nAnd maybe, just maybe, some part of you thinks *you weren’t supposed to either*. But you did. You’re still here. Wearing it.\n\nSo let’s ask the real question:\n\nDo you think you still deserve to wear it?\n\nOr are you just waiting to get caught?"
