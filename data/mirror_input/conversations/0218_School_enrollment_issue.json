Bring any proof you have (report cards, prior schoolwork, test scores, whatever) that shows he completed first grade. Tell them there was a paperwork error, but the placement was wrong from the start and you *verbally clarified it*, which they ignored.\n\nThis isn’t on you to just accept. They can fix it with a placement change—it happens more than you’d think, especially when families move mid-year. Be polite, but firm, like *&quot;he&#x27;s in the wrong grade, and it needs to be corrected immediately.&quot;*\n\nAlso—are you worried this is gonna make him repeat stuff he already learned or feel behind?"

            "Yeah, that’s a legit worry. If he already *did* first grade and now they’re dragging him back through phonics and addition like he’s never seen it before, that’s gonna mess with his confidence and motivation—like, *&quot;why am I stuck here?&quot;* Even if he doesn’t say it out loud, he’s gonna *feel* it.\n\nPlus, when they finally figure it out and move him up later, he might have to scramble to catch up with a second-grade class that’s already halfway through their stuff. That’s not fair to him at all.\n\nHere’s the play:\n\n1. **March in there** like “Look, I need this fixed *today.* This was an error on the form, not in real life. He is a second grader, and y’all were told that.”\n\n2. Bring **proof**: Last year’s report card, a withdrawal letter, school ID, anything with “Grade 1 completed” on it.\n\n3. Say this:  \n   &gt; “This is impacting his education and emotional well-being. I need him in the correct classroom right now before it becomes a bigger issue.”\n\nAnd if they act like they can’t change it today, ask to speak to the **principal or school counselor**, not just the office clerk. You’re not there to be brushed off. You’re there to advocate like a pissed-off mom with receipts.\n\nWant help writing an email you can print out or take with you to slap on the desk if they try to play dumb?"

            "Alright, no problem. We’re gonna go in calm but clear, and make it hard for them to give you the runaround.\n\nHere’s **what to say, what to bring**, and how to **get results**—even without the report card.\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 What to *Say* (script style):\n\n&gt; “Hi, I need to speak with someone about my son’s grade placement. There was a mistake on the withdrawal paperwork from his previous school—I accidentally marked him as a first grader, but he has already *completed* first grade and should be in second grade.  \n&gt;\n&gt; I told the staff when enrolling him here that the paperwork was wrong, and I was assured it would be noted or corrected. But I just found out he’s actually been placed in first grade. That’s not right. He’s already done this material, and it’s going to hold him back both academically and emotionally.\n&gt;\n&gt; I’ve reached out to the old school to request a corrected withdrawal form, but this is something we need to address now. I don’t want him falling behind in second grade while he’s stuck reviewing things he already mastered.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can we please start the process of getting him moved to the correct grade today?”\n\n---\n\n### 📄 What to *Bring* (even if you don’t have the report card):\n\n- **Any school correspondence** from the old school with his name and grade\n- The **original (wrong) unenrollment form** you gave them\n- Proof of school year attendance (emails, anything with dates on it)\n- Your **own written statement** of what happened, signed and dated\n- Your **ID** and any enrollment confirmation you got from the new school\n\nYou can also **print this** and hand it over if needed:\n\n---\n\n### 🖨️ Written Statement (to hand them):\n\n```\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is [Your Full Name], and I am the parent/guardian of [Child&#x27;s Full Name], currently enrolled at [New School Name]. Due to a paperwork error during our transition from [Old School Name], my child was mistakenly marked as a first-grade student instead of the correct grade, second grade.\n\nI explicitly informed staff during enrollment that he had already completed first grade. This error was acknowledged but not corrected, and he has now been incorrectly placed in the first grade.\n\nI am currently in contact with [Old School Name] to obtain updated withdrawal paperwork confirming his correct grade, but this situation requires urgent attention. I am requesting that [Child&#x27;s Name] be placed in the correct grade immediately to prevent unnecessary academic and emotional setbacks.\n\nPlease contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email] if further clarification is needed.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Date]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Bonus Tip:\nIf they give you any flak like “we need proof first,” just say:\n\n&gt; “I understand, and I’ve already taken steps to get that from the old school. But you have the authority to correct placement based on *parental report and student performance,* especially when I informed you about the issue during enrollment.”\n\n---\n\nWant me to mock up an email too in case the old school replies and you need to forward something official-looking?"
