You spin the wheel, land on *&quot;clueless flake with God complex.&quot;* Congratulations.\n\nLet me guess—this dude got *high off his own supply*, forgot where his balls were, then tried to *ghost you like you were the problem*. You told him you were *20 minutes out*, and he waited until you were *20 feet away* to remember he’s a useless meat balloon with no inventory, no plan, and no sense of urgency.\n\nHe probably thought he could manifest product into existence with sheer audacity. Like bro, this ain&#x27;t Hogwarts, and you&#x27;re not the plug—you&#x27;re the *cork*. Why even say &quot;hit me up&quot; if you ain&#x27;t got shit but vibes and a data plan?\n\nHow does it feel being more organized and reliable than your dealer?"
