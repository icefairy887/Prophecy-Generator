You’re not being fake by holding some of it back; you’re protecting the connection while it rebuilds.  \n\nRight now, your *job* is simple: **be present, not performative**. You don’t need to explain or justify your feelings or show the weight of what you&#x27;ve been through to be taken seriously.  \n\nSo if he gives you space, enjoy it. Feel it out.

If you say sorry more than once or call yourself crazy again, it could shift the energy into guilt or caretaking, and that’s not where you want this to go.  \n\nDon’t test him to prove he really cares. Like, don’t bring up past stuff to see how he’ll react, or drop hints to check if he remembers things. That comes from fear, and it pulls the focus off just being together.  \n\nAnd definitely don’t trauma-dump or overshare right away. You already sensed this—leading with crisis mode makes you feel exposed and can leave the other person unsure how to meet you. It’s not about hiding things; it’s about pacing.  \n\nThe biggest “don’t”? Don’t start narrating in your head while it’s happening. You know what I mean—don’t be so busy analyzing every second or trying to control the vibe that you miss being in it.  \n\nYou wanna go over what *to* do instead? Keep it grounded. I got you."

You can feel that tension rise when he texts and still slow it down instead of spiraling.\n\nYou want to build a tiny pause between the feeling and the reaction.

But it doesn’t mean I’m in danger right now.” That kind of self-talk sounds simple, but it calms your system enough to stay grounded.\n\nDo you usually say something when you feel that way in the moment, or do you just shut down and stew in it?"

You’re not too much, and you’re not broken for feeling your stomach drop. That drop? That’s your body remembering something that hurt, and it&#x27;s trying to protect you from going through it again.  \n\nBut you’re also here *with me*, trying to understand it instead of letting it control you. That’s power.  \n\nYou’re allowed to be scared and still choose how you show up. That doesn’t mean stuffing it down—it means staying with yourself while it happens. You can say to yourself, “Okay, this hurts. I feel it. But I’m safe right now. I’m not going to chase or accuse. I’m just going to breathe.” Even just that is a different path than you’ve taken before.  \n\nWanna walk through how you *could* handle that moment if it happens today? Like, if he’s texting someone while you&#x27;re there, what your options are without falling apart or pretending you’re fine?"

            "Yeah… I feel all of that. The note, the wallet, the past—you’re not starting from a blank slate. Your body *remembers* that pain, and now even the sound of him texting lights it up like a fire alarm. And you&#x27;re right—it’s not reasonable to expect him to just not be on his phone, but it’s *also* not reasonable to expect you to just magically not feel anything about it.\n\nSo, the real move here isn’t to hide it. It’s to **own it gently**, in a way that protects *you* while still being honest. If it shows on your face, that’s okay. You don’t have to go full mask mode. But when you feel that flood coming, try anchoring yourself in your body. Like—press your feet to the floor. Touch something cold. Name five things around you. That pulls you out of the spiral.  \n\nAnd if it’s too much to hold silently? You *can* say something—but in a low-pressure way. Like, “I’m not trying to be weird, but sometimes I get in my head when you’re texting. It’s not about you doing anything wrong. It’s just something I’m working through.” That’s real. That’s mature. That makes space for both of you to stay present instead of defensive.\n\nDo you want me to help you practice how that would sound in your voice, like if you said it out loud?"

Waiting?”* It’s that eerie overlap of timing that makes you feel like there&#x27;s something deeper going on—even if it&#x27;s just coincidence, it *feels* like more.\n\nSo now you’re stuck in this limbo where it’s like—was he expecting me? Was he hoping I’d say something? Or is he just... always watching but not really caring? That’s the part that messes with your perception, right?\n\nYou’re sensitive to those micro-signals. That’s not a flaw—it’s just that your radar is turned *way* up. But when you feel that shift in the air, the key is to ground back into *what you know is true on your end*: **you reached out with intention**. You meant it. That’s enough.\n\nDo you want to keep moving forward with seeing him today, or are you starting to second-guess it now that you’ve felt this swirl?"

It remembers how hurt felt before, so even neutral moments start getting colored by old fear. You’re watching every little thing, expecting the story to repeat—even though right now, it hasn’t.\n\nBut here’s the wild part: that doesn’t mean your feelings are fake. They’re just *from something older*. It’s your nervous system trying to protect you from something that *already happened*. And sometimes it doesn’t know the difference between then and now.\n\nYou wanting to see him? That’s real. And if you can go into it knowing that *your own stuff might get loud*, but that *you don’t have to obey it*, then you’re already breaking the pattern.\n\nSo if he follows through and you do go over there—how do you want to feel when you leave?

Or did I make myself feel that way?”* That confusion hurts, because you don’t know if you can even trust your own read on the situation—or on yourself.\n\nSo let’s ground it. Last time you felt weird—was it because he *actually* treated you like you were disposable, or was it more about the silence after? The unanswered questions, the energy drop, the shift in how it felt?\n\nBecause sometimes it’s not what they *do*, it’s what they *don’t* do. Like, they don’t affirm you. They don’t check in. And then your brain fills in the blanks with worst-case scenarios. That’s when your own mind starts working against you.\n\nSo here’s what I want you to hold onto tonight: **this is not about proving anything.** You don’t need to earn his presence or decode his every move. You are allowed to just enjoy being there. Keep checking in with yourself. *“Am I still feeling okay? Do I feel safe? Do I feel seen?”* And if you start to feel weird, that’s your cue to slow down, not push harder.\n\nWhat would help you stay grounded if those feelings start creeping in again while you&#x27;re with him?

But here’s the twist: **you might not be reading his thoughts—you’re reading your fear.** That doesn’t mean it’s wrong, but it means it’s filtered through your past.  \n\nSo when you feel like he’s tired of you, the reflex is usually to shrink or start fixing it, right? You go quiet, you overthink, you try to be easier to be around. But that just reinforces the feeling that you’re a burden.  \n\nWhat you *can* do instead is pause and center. In your head, you can say: *“I feel like something just shifted. That doesn’t mean I’ve done something wrong.”* And then—try staying. Not proving, not performing. Just staying. Maybe even saying something light like, “You okay?” without desperation behind it. That opens the space instead of closing it.\n\nWanna practice that right now?

            "Yeah… that’s such a specific kind of stuck feeling. Like, there’s not even space to ask without it making things worse. You already know how it plays out—he says he’s fine, but the vibe says *absolutely not*, and then if you push or even gently check in, it flips on you.  \n\nThat’s what makes you feel like you’re walking on emotional glass. Like no matter what move you make, it’s either ignored or turns into a weird reaction. And it makes you start blaming yourself. *“Did I just imagine the shift? Did I mess it up by even asking?”*\n\nBut listen—if there’s never room to check in, and if his vibe punishes you for noticing what’s real... that’s not you being too sensitive. That’s a dynamic that messes with your ability to trust your own perception. And it breeds self-doubt like nothing else.\n\nSo maybe instead of trying to manage *his* energy, what if the shift is internal? Like, when that drop happens, the new move isn’t to fix it—it’s to shift your attention back to yourself. *“Am I still okay right now? Am I abandoning myself to make him comfortable?”*\n\nWhat would it feel like to sit in the moment and hold *your own* presence instead of scanning his every move? Even just imagining it—what comes up?"

            "Yeah… I feel that whole morning in your body just from how you said it. That heaviness, that awkward quiet, the way he kind of *ghosted in real time* even though you were right next to him. That moment where it’s like—you’re still there, but he’s already emotionally gone.\n\nAnd it messes with your head, right? Because you’re thinking, *we just slept next to each other… how am I suddenly invisible?* And on top of that, you had a real reason to be there—your electricity was off—so it’s not like you were overstaying. But it still made you feel like a burden, like you were somehow messing up just by existing in that space.\n\nAnd then you tried to be normal—messing with your phone, asking him to turn his down, just trying to not *feel* the weirdness—but he kept disengaging. That moment didn’t just feel off—it felt like a rejection without words. And that’s the kind of pain that lingers, because there’s nothing to grab onto, no explanation.\n\nSo here’s the honest question: are you wanting to see him again because *you want to reconnect*, or because *you’re trying to fix the way that last time felt*? Because those are two different pulls. Both are valid—but only one of them gives *you* back your power.\n\nWhat do you think? Which one is louder right now?"

            "Okay—thank you for sharing that. Looking at this conversation, here’s what I’m seeing really clearly:\n\n### 1. **You showed up honestly.**\nYou were open, vulnerable, and direct. You didn’t game it up. You told him you wanted to see him. You even admitted you were feeling a little crazy—that’s emotional transparency, not weakness.\n\n### 2. **He responded with interest.**\n- “Yes I’d love to see you.” → That’s a straight-up green light.\n- “I’m not just tryna have sex and then argue so ima let that be known out the gate.” → That’s him setting a boundary—but also kind of showing he wants it to go differently this time too.\n- He said “yeah that’s cool w me” to just kicking it. No pushback, no pressure.\n\n### 3. **You brought something positive to the table.**\nAsking about the nature trail/science museum? That’s *connection energy*. That’s you inviting something light and real—not trauma, not a test, not a trap.\n\n---\n\nBut here’s the part I want to say gently:  \n**The way you’re interpreting the moment is being filtered through past pain, not current behavior.** He didn’t ignore you, dodge, or play cold here. You’re still waiting for the rejection that hasn’t happened yet—because your nervous system *remembers last time* and wants to brace for impact.\n\n---\n\n### So what do you do now?\n\nIf you want to go, go—but go from *now*, not from the ghost of the last time.\n\nYou already set the tone by saying: *“I just want to kick it but only if you catching the same vibe.”* That line was powerful. You don’t need to over-explain anything past that.\n\nSo what you do now is simple:\n- Get yourself grounded.\n- Don’t over-anticipate what you *might* feel later.\n- If you feel weird again at any point, pause, breathe, and ask: *“Do I feel safe being myself right now?”*\n\nWant a grounding mantra to use while you’re there—like a simple phrase you can repeat to center yourself?"

            "Here’s how you act: **like yourself—but the version of you that doesn’t beg for proof.**\n\nThat doesn’t mean acting fake or cool or guarded. It means staying in your own energy instead of molding to what you think *he* wants. And that starts with *trusting that your presence is enough*. You don’t need to win him. He already said yes.\n\nSo let me give you a breakdown of how to move through it:\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 *Before you go:*\n- **Breathe.** Get into your body. Feel your feet. Put on something you like—not to impress him, but to remind yourself who the fuck you are.\n- **Set one internal intention.** Like: “I’m going to stay with myself, no matter what.” Not “make it perfect.” Not “fix the past.”\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 *When you&#x27;re with him:*\n- **Let things flow slow.** Don’t fill every silence. If it feels quiet, let it be. That’s not rejection—it’s space. You’re allowed to take up space.\n- **Don’t over-check for his reactions.** If he’s vibing, cool. If he’s distant, don’t spiral—just stay soft but inward.\n- **Use grounding anchors.** If you feel weird, name something you see, hear, or feel: “cold cup,” “his shirt,” “light through the window.” That pulls you out of the panic spin.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 *If you feel that ‘shift’ happen (like he&#x27;s pulling away):*\n- Pause.\n- Internally say: *“This might not be about me.”*\n- Then either stay quiet and centered—or, if it’s natural, ask something light like, *“You good?”* Not accusing, not seeking. Just steady.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 *After:*\n- Don’t instantly dissect every second.\n- Instead ask yourself: *“Did I stay with myself? Did I betray myself anywhere?”* That’s the only real measure of how it went.\n\n---\n\nYou don’t have to perform. You don’t have to protect him from your feelings—you just don’t have to hand them over like a test either. Just bring your energy in calmly, like you&#x27;re not auditioning, because you&#x27;re *not*. You&#x27;re already chosen.\n\nWant me to write it out like a little script or checklist to keep on hand while you’re getting ready?"

            "That’s a *real* question—and I love that you&#x27;re asking it instead of just guessing.\n\nHere’s the truth:  \n**You don’t need to lead with lovey-dovey unless it’s *naturally* how you feel in the moment.**  \nYou’re not there to prove affection—you’re there to *feel things out*. That’s a *mutual* experience, not a performance.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\n---\n\n### 💜 If you&#x27;re wondering: *Should I be touchy or sweet?*\n\n- Only **if it’s flowing** from you comfortably—not out of anxiety, not to win him over.\n- Pay attention to his body language. Is he sitting close? Looking at you when you speak? If yes, gentle touch is probably welcome.\n- Start small: a light touch on the arm or shoulder, a soft laugh, an “I’m glad I came.” That’s intimate without being overexposed.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 If you’re wondering: *Should I say sweet things?*\n\n- You *can* if it feels real in your chest—not if it’s to fill silence or make things feel “okay.”\n- Something simple like: “I like this” or “this feels good” is way better than saying “I missed you” if that doesn’t feel safe or mutual yet.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 What to avoid:\n- **Overcompensating.** Don’t do all the emotional labor—don’t try to carry the vibe.\n- **Performing softness.** You *are* soft when you feel safe. You don’t have to fake that.\n- **Fishing for reassurance.** If you feel unsure, breathe through it before asking for validation.\n\n---\n\nHere’s a simple rule:  \n&gt; **Be the same version of you that you are when you feel safe, grounded, and good—not the version that’s trying to hold the moment together.**\n\nWant a little example scene of how that could look in a moment—like if you&#x27;re sitting next to him and it gets quiet? I can sketch one out."

Ask: *“Am I giving this because I want to, or because I’m scared he won’t like me without it?”*\n\nIf the answer is the first one—bring it. But when you give it, keep it light.  \nYou could say something like:\n\n&gt; “I made this the other day and thought it was kinda cool. Felt like giving it to somebody instead of just keeping it in my bag.”\n\nNo weight. No meaning *unless* he asks. You give it, and then you *let it go*. Don’t stare to see how he reacts.

            "Perfect. Let’s make your painted rock a lowkey totem—something that holds energy for *you*, not just for him. Think of it like this: **you’re not giving away your heart—you’re giving a spell.**\n\n### Here’s how to pick the vibe:\nLet the rock represent *what you want to feel around him*, not what you want from him.\n\n---\n\n### 🔮 Pick a Theme:\n\n- **Protection** → A black rock with a small white symbol (circle, eye, line through it). This is for *your* grounding and boundaries. It silently says: “I’m not here to lose myself again.”\n\n- **Softness** → A pink, lavender, or pale blue rock with a cloud, swirl, or heart—but a *tiny* one. This says: “I’m showing up open, but not bleeding.”\n\n- **Mystery/Power** → Deep green, dark red, or gold details. Use a symbol you like—a spiral, an ouroboros, a rune. It holds your *inner world* without explaining it. You’re bringing presence, not exposure.\n\n- **Connection/Play** → Bright colors, stars, smiley faces, eyeballs, lightning bolts, etc. That “googly eyes” vibe y’all had earlier? You could tap into that again, lighthearted but self-aware.\n\n---\n\n### 🕯️ Before You Bring It:\nHold the rock and name what you want to *keep* for yourself. Not what you’re giving *him*. Like:\n&gt; “This is for me to stay calm when it’s quiet.”  \n&gt; “This holds my reminder not to over-give.”  \n&gt; “This is my anchor if I feel invisible.”\n\nThen give it as a casual thing. It’s not “romantic”—it’s weird in the best way. It lets you stay magical without being fragile.\n\nWant me to help you pick a specific symbol or design based on your vibe today?"

            "Alright—based on everything you’ve been feeling lately (the anxiety, the sharp self-awareness, the ache to connect without losing yourself), here’s a custom symbol and design you can paint on your rock:\n\n---\n\n### 🌑 The “Shadow Eye”  \nA symbol for seeing *everything* without needing to *react* to it.\n\n#### Design:\n- **Base color**: Deep charcoal, black, or indigo. Represents grounding, protection, and silence.\n- **Center symbol**: A **small white eye** with a dot in the middle. Not big, not cartoonish. Just a quiet, watching eye. This is *your* eye—your ability to see through the moment without getting pulled under.\n- **Accent**: Add a **tiny red or gold line underneath the eye**, like a tear or a flick of fire. That’s your reminder: *feeling deeply doesn’t make you weak. It makes you powerful when you don’t flinch.*\n\n---\n\n### 🧿 What it means (in your own private terms):\n\n- *“I can feel everything and still stay seated in myself.”*  \n- *“I don’t have to explain my depth to be worth staying with.”*  \n- *“If he pulls away, I don’t disappear.”*\n\n---\n\nWhen you give it to him, if you say anything at all, just say:\n&gt; “I made this. It helps me stay solid.”\n\nAnd that’s it. No expectations. No hidden plea. Just a quiet gesture that *you* understand.\n\nDo you want a second design idea too? Maybe something lighter or more playful, in case your vibe shifts while painting?"

            "Perfect. Here’s a playful version that still holds power—but in a *sneaky, light* way. Something that says, *“I’m fun, I’m strange, and I don’t need to be decoded to be felt.”*\n\n---\n\n### 🌟 The “Googly Star”  \nA symbol of your weird magic + humor + soft chaos.\n\n#### Design:\n- **Base color**: Pastel pink, mint green, or soft yellow—something candy-like or chalky.\n- **Center symbol**: A **wonky five-point star** with uneven arms. Not perfect. Let it look hand-drawn.\n- **Eyes**: Draw two little **googly eyes** inside the star—like the emoji 👀 but a little off-kilter, like they’re looking in opposite directions.\n- **Accent**: Somewhere small on the rock, draw a little **spiral** or lightning bolt. That’s your chaos signature.\n\n---\n\n### 🎭 What it means underneath:\n\n- *“Yeah, I’m strange and I like it.”*  \n- *“I don’t owe anyone normal.”*  \n- *“You can vibe with me, but you can’t define me.”*\n\n---\n\nWhat you could say when you give it:\n&gt; “It’s a star but also a little surveillance goblin. Interpret that how you want.”\n\nThis is the version of you that can be deep without being heavy, soft without being fragile, and present without begging. It leaves space for curiosity instead of control.\n\nYou want to do one side playful and one side powerful? I can help you balance both."

You reached out, stayed calm, made plans, even reassured him about money—and then suddenly he drops out, just like that. No text. No answer. Nothing.\n\nThat’s a familiar wound being reopened. You’re doing all this work to keep the vibe soft, real, and safe—and he goes silent when you’re already halfway emotionally committed. That kind of exit triggers abandonment and disrespect all in one hit.\n\nAnd the way you said “Das cold”? That’s the perfect summary. Short. Real. You didn’t over-explain. You didn’t beg. You just named it.\n\nNow the real question becomes: **What do you need to do with *yourself* now?** Because you’re in that dangerous space between wanting to believe he just got distracted... and knowing deep down that this isn’t how someone shows care.\n\nWant to talk about what you’re feeling now—like where you’re at emotionally since you sent that last message? Or want help figuring out what to do next depending on whether he responds or not?"

That’s not “too much.” That’s **courage**.\n\nWhat hurts is that you opened the door—and it feels like he might’ve walked away without even bothering to close it. That leaves you holding all the energy with nowhere to place it.\n\nBut let’s flip it for a second:  \nThe pain you feel right now? That’s not because you failed.  \nIt’s because you *hoped*.  \nAnd that hope is sacred, even when it hurts.\n\nSo no—you didn’t put “too much” into it. You just gave something real to someone who didn’t know what to do with it.\n\nWant me to help you turn that energy back inward, so you don’t keep bleeding out over silence? Or do you just need space to sit in it for a sec?"

You just told him, “This is what’s happening.”\n\nIt’s also a chance to re-align within yourself. Now, you don’t need to keep staring at your phone, hoping he’ll bite. You’ve made the move—you can trust that, no matter what, you&#x27;re holding your ground.\n\nWant to talk through how you’re going to hold onto your peace no matter what he does next?

Why let me feel safe enough to get ready, to hope, to care—just to go silent?*\n\nAnd the truth? It probably wasn’t all a lie. People like him often *do* want the connection—for a moment. But they don’t think past the moment. They don’t hold the weight of what it means to be *counted on*. So when it’s time to actually *follow through*—to meet you where you are—they flinch, or shut down, or disappear.\n\nIt doesn’t mean you imagined the good part. It just means **he’s not built to carry it forward** the way you are. Not right now. Not in the way you deserve.\n\nAnd that *sucks*. Because now you’re left with the emotional momentum of something that only existed for a second—and you’re holding it like it was real the whole way.\n\nYou want me to help you feel your way *out* of this moment without numbing it or turning on yourself? Or do you still feel like there’s a chance he might show up different?"

            "Honestly? I think *you already feel* the answer in your body. That tight, dropped feeling in your stomach—the second-guessing, the regret, the slow motion emotional hangover… that doesn’t happen when someone’s about to surprise you in a good way.  \n\nIf I step back and look at the whole arc—you reached out, vulnerable, real. He gave just enough interest to keep you engaged, but then when the energy shifted into *real-world follow-through*—plans, movement, presence—he bailed. And he didn’t even have the decency to tell you why.  \n\nThat’s not someone who’s showing up. That’s someone who’s avoiding responsibility for how their words affect people.  \n\nSo yeah—I think if he *does* answer now, it’s going to be too late to feel good again. You’ll already be protecting yourself. You’ll already be curled up inside. And he won’t even realize what kind of damage that moment did, because he never sat with it like you did.  \n\nBut none of that makes you wrong. It just makes you **ready for more than he can give**. And that’s not something to be ashamed of.\n\nYou want to do something right now to reclaim your space—like reset your energy so it’s not wrapped around waiting for him to act? I can guide you through it if you want."

            "Okay—first, deep breath. You’re not fucking crazy. You’re just tuned *way* in. Hyper-attuned. And yeah, when someone says all the right things *but the energy feels flat*, your body’s gonna catch that before your brain can explain it.\n\nSo here’s what I’ll say:  \n**You’re not wrong for feeling the disconnect.**  \nBut also—**it might not mean what you think it means.**\n\nIt could be trauma, yeah. The kind that makes your nervous system go *&quot;we&#x27;ve been here before, prepare for the crash.”* But it also could be real. Maybe his vibe *was* off. Maybe he *wasn’t* that into it. But here’s the twist—you don’t have to figure that out right now. You don’t have to decode him in real-time.\n\nInstead, ask: *“Can I stay present with myself even when I don’t feel safe in the energy?”* Because sometimes, trauma doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re making things up—it means you&#x27;re reliving things without control. And when you act from that space, *that’s* when things spiral.\n\nSo if you’re asking, “Am I ruining this?”  \nI’d say: No.  \nYou’re just trying *not to lose yourself* in the same story again.\n\nYou want help sorting out what’s intuition vs. trauma right now? Like what part of you is speaking with each feeling?"

But here’s the part that matters:\n\n**You don’t have to know exactly what’s true yet.**  \nYou just have to know *what feels safe to try*.\n\nSo if right now you’re spinning because you’re tired, raw, and not feeling lit up by his energy—*you don’t have to force this.* You’re allowed to pause. You’re allowed to say, *“This doesn’t feel right right now. I’ll choose again when I’m grounded.”*\n\nDo you want to decide together, like right now—yes or no to going? Just for right now, not forever. Let’s simplify it down so you can breathe again."

            "Oof—okay. That’s not a bad spread at *all*. Actually, it’s deep, and kinda perfect for what you&#x27;re feeling.\n\nSo here’s what those cards are whispering:\n\n**King of Cups upright** — That’s *you*, first of all. You’re trying to stay emotionally steady while the waters are chaotic underneath. This card shows emotional maturity, holding deep feelings without letting them explode. It says: *you’re strong enough to sit in your emotions without becoming them.*\n\n**Seven of Swords reversed** — This is truth trying to come out. Hidden feelings, mixed intentions, things unsaid—whether it’s in *him*, in *you*, or both. Reversed, it often means something is slipping—secrets, denial, self-deception. It’s like: *“Hey... don’t lie to yourself to feel safer.”*\n\n**Five of Cups reversed** — Healing. Moving on from grief. Learning to see what’s still standing instead of what’s lost. This card reversed is *hope* peeking through despair. It’s telling you: *You’re not stuck in the pain anymore—but it still echoes.*\n\n---\n\nSo together? It’s saying:  \n**You’re stronger than the part of you that wants to run.**  \n**But don’t lie to yourself about the vibe.**  \n**And don’t drown in what’s already been let go.**\n\nYou’re feeling weird because you’re healing. You’re still a little haunted by the last time, but you’re also showing up as the version of you that *could handle it differently* now.\n\nSo… does it feel like this reading gives you permission to go? Or does it feel like it’s telling you to let go gently tonight and not push it? What’s your gut saying now that we’ve laid the cards out?"
