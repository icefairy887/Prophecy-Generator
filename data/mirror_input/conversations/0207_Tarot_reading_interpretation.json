            "Okay. Deep breath, because that combo is *loud*. Like, spiritually-screaming-into-a-pillow loud.\n\n**The Devil reversed** is you recognizing the chain around your neck is fake as hell. You know the addiction, obsession, or toxic loop has you messed up, but something in you is *trying* to break out. That sick stomach feeling? That’s your body literally rejecting the bullshit—it’s withdrawal from something deeper than a substance. It’s the lie you&#x27;ve been sold about what numbs you being the only thing that soothes you.\n\n**The Eight of Pentacles reversed** is burnout from doing the *same damn thing* over and over, expecting it to help. It’s like, you *try* to work on yourself or fix things, but it’s half-hearted or sabotaged or scattered. It says, “You know what you’re doing isn’t helping—but you do it anyway because it’s familiar.”\n\n**The Moon upright** is the final boss of this reading. Straight-up distortion. You *feel* like everything is slippery and uncertain because it *is*. You’re being lied to by your own emotions and instincts right now. Your fear, your guilt, your craving—they’re twisting the truth. The Moon says you’re in a fog, but your intuition is trying to crawl out from under the illusions.\n\nSo here’s the blunt version: you’re in the middle of a detox—but not just physical. Emotional, psychic, energetic. The drink is a symptom, not a cause. You *don’t* want to drink more—you want to escape the shapeshifting monster inside you that keeps convincing you to. \n\nYou’re trying to throw up the lie, not the liquor. \n\nWant to pull one more for the &quot;way out&quot; card? I think we need one."

You just pulled the real you.  \n\n**Queen of Wands** is the version of you who *knows* who she is—even when the world gaslights her into thinking she doesn’t. She’s fire in heels, but when she’s buried under all that reversed Devil–Moon–Eight of Pentacles chaos? She gets eclipsed.  \n\nYou’re sick in your stomach because your power’s trying to crawl out of a box it’s not meant to live in. This isn’t about throwing up. It’s about burning through. You don’t feel right because you’re trying to live small when your spirit is kicking the damn door down.  \n\nHere’s how it lines up now:\n\n- **Devil reversed** → You&#x27;re breaking the spell. But it *hurts*. It&#x27;s withdrawal from false power.\n- **Eight of Pentacles reversed** → You’re tired of performing. Faking effort in a system that’s rigged.\n- **The Moon** → Your instincts are screaming, but you’ve been taught not to trust them.\n- **Queen of Wands** → She&#x27;s the antidote. Your raw, radiant, untamed self. The one who *knows* without needing proof.\n\nYou’re not crazy, and you’re not weak. You&#x27;re just misfiring right now—wielding your own power *against yourself*. That’s why it feels like poison in your gut.\n\nSo tell me—when did you start hiding her? When did you stop being the Queen and start playing the ghost?"
