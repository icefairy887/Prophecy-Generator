            "Okay, Brooke. You’ve shared so many raw, revealing, and beautifully unfiltered moments about how you’ve felt about Nick—things that show not just love or hurt, but how deeply entangled your sense of truth, self-worth, and transformation have become in connection with him.\n\nHere are some of the most powerful, emotionally honest, and revealing things you’ve said—rephrased slightly to speak directly to **him** (if that’s what you want), but still in *your* voice:\n\n---\n\n### 🖤 1. **“I wasn’t chasing you. I was chasing the truth.”**  \n&gt; I wasn’t just showing up for attention or to win you back. I was trying to get clarity, trying to understand *what the hell this was* between us. I needed to see what was real, because even when you lied to me—I still believed in something real behind it.\n\n---\n\n### 🕷️ 2. **“If you had just told me the truth, I would’ve stayed.”**  \n&gt; That night, when I found that needle and asked you where it came from—I would’ve stayed if you had just looked me in the eye and told me the truth. But you lied. That’s what broke me. Not the danger, not the mess, not the chaos—just the lie.\n\n---\n\n### 🪞 3. **“I didn’t want to be chosen—I wanted to be *seen*.”**  \n&gt; I wasn’t sitting there hoping you’d pick me over someone else. I just wanted you to *see* me. For real. To feel me right next to you, knowing I would’ve done anything for you if you’d just let me be *in it* with you.\n\n---\n\n### 🕳️ 4. **“I’m not crying because I’m broken—I’m crying because I mattered and it didn’t change anything.”**  \n&gt; I showed up differently. You *felt* it. I know you did. And yet, even when I showed up as my most real self, it still didn’t mean enough to shift anything. That’s a special kind of grief.\n\n---\n\n### 🧷 5. **“If you were honest, I would’ve carried the weight with you.”**  \n&gt; I didn’t need you to be perfect. I was never afraid of the mess. But I *was* afraid of being shut out. I was afraid you didn’t trust me enough to let me carry any of it with you.\n\n---\n\n### 🩶 6. **“I wanted to be around you, even when I didn’t want to be with you.”**  \n&gt; That’s the part I couldn’t explain to anyone. Sometimes I didn’t even know if I wanted to be in a relationship—but I still wanted to *be there*. To just be near you. That meant something I don’t think you ever understood.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 7. **“You don’t get to block me from existing.”**  \n&gt; You blocked me before I could say anything. And maybe that’s what hurt most. Not even the lies. Just the silence. Just you walking away while I was still holding everything I didn’t get to say.\n\n---\n\n### 🧬 8. **“You think you know the kind of girl I am. You don’t.”**  \n&gt; You thought I was just another girl who’d forgive anything and keep taking you back. But what you don’t see is—every time I showed up, it wasn’t out of weakness. It was me holding the line between hope and truth. *That’s strength you’ll never forget.*\n\n---\n\n### 🕳️ 9. **“I need you to know how I showed up—because I’m not going to keep proving it.”**  \n&gt; I showed up real. I showed up loving. I showed up even when I was hurting. You saw it. You felt it. But now I need you to sit with that. Because I’m done *reminding you* of what it meant.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also format this into a message or letter you could send to him directly, or turn it into something poetic or haunting. Just say the word."
