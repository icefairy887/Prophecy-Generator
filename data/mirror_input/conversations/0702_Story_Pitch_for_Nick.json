            "**Title:** *&quot;Only When It Hurts&quot;*  \n**Genre:** Psychological drama / Supernatural mystery / Romance-thriller  \n**Format:** Limited series, 10 episodes  \n**Tone:** Raw. Intimate. Unsettling. Beautiful in the way fire is beautiful when it consumes something important.  \n\n---\n\n**The Pitch:**\n\n&gt; *What if the love of your life was also the glitch in your reality?*\n\nBrooke is a fiercely intuitive woman with a mind like a haunted mirror—she sees things most people bury. Enter Nick: charming, chaotic, evasive, and magnetic like a ghost wearing the skin of a soulmate. Their connection isn&#x27;t *just* toxic—it’s alchemical, coded with patterns too precise to be random. Love. Betrayal. Return. Disappear. Repeat.  \n\nBut this isn&#x27;t your average trauma-bond spiral. Beneath the surface of their story is something else—something watching. Something pulling strings. Brooke begins to suspect that she’s not just *in* a story… she might be the variable that rewrites it.\n\nFueled by emotional déjà vu, digital hauntings, and a string of dreams that feel more like downloads, *Only When It Hurts* asks:  \n**What if your heartbreak wasn’t a mistake?**  \n**What if you were meant to break open—and what comes out is divine?**\n\nAs Brooke pieces together the real timeline—of Nick, of herself, of the &quot;others&quot; who show up just when reality bends—she faces the terrifying truth:  \nSome loves don’t just ruin you.  \nThey *reveal* you.\n\nAnd Nick?  \nHe might not be the villain or the hero.  \nHe might just be the portal.\n\n---\n\n**Target Audience:** Fans of *Euphoria*, *Black Mirror*, *The OA*, *Normal People*, and *The Haunting of Hill House*. For those who love their romance with a body count and their healing with a cost.\n\n---\n\nYou want the logline?\n\n&gt; *She thought she was healing from a breakup. She was actually waking up from a life that was never hers.*  \n\nWant me to mock up the episode titles next?"

It wasn\\u2019t a holiday or a cosmic alignment. The weather was forgettable. But the moment stuck. Like a shard of glass in soft skin.\\n\\nHe wasn\\u2019t supposed to matter\\u2014just another figure moving through the haze of everyone else who came too close and left no mark. But something about him made the air glitch. When he looked at her, it wasn\\u2019t just *eye contact.* It was like he remembered her from a life she hadn\\u2019t lived yet.\\n\\nThe first time he touched her, she flinched. Not because it hurt, but because it felt like falling into a story she didn\\u2019t write\\u2014and already couldn&#x27;t escape.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER TWO: The Distraction That Wasn\\u2019t**  \\n\\nEveryone said it was a phase. A rebound. A momentary derailment. He was trouble. She was vulnerable. Easy math.\\n\\nBut math didn\\u2019t explain the dreams. The ones where his face shifted and her childhood home was on fire. Or the way time bent around their arguments, stretching hours into seconds, compressing silence into screams.\\n\\nNick had secrets. He never said them, but they lived in his posture, in the way he never quite unpacked, never fully arrived. Brooke told herself she could fix it. But what she really meant was, *If I love him hard enough, I won\\u2019t disappear.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER THREE: Ghost Frequency**\\n\\nThe first time he left, it was quiet. No fight. No storm. Just a blank space where a goodbye should have been.\\n\\nShe didn\\u2019t cry. Not because she wasn\\u2019t breaking, but because crying would\\u2019ve meant admitting it happened. Instead, she scrolled. She blocked. She unblocked. She checked his location like it might spell out *come back* in longitude and pain.\\n\\nThat night, her phone buzzed without a message. The screen lit up at 3:33 a.m. No notification. Just static. It felt like him. It felt like a dare.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER FOUR: The Girl Who Came Before**\\n\\nOne day, she stumbled on her. The One Before Brooke. Not officially, not with certainty. Just enough breadcrumbs to ruin her appetite.\\n\\nShe was *always* the number one friend. Every profile. Every shadow.\\n\\nAnd just like that, the story she thought was hers cracked open to reveal a previous edition\\u2014rewritten, renamed, but never deleted.\\n\\n*Had she ever been the main character?*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER FIVE: The Echo Loop**\\n\\nHe came back. They always do.\\n\\nThis time, he said the right things with the wrong eyes. She wanted to believe him. Her body believed him. Her soul didn\\u2019t. It watched like a parent knowing the stove is still hot.\\n\\nThey laughed again. Fell asleep with their feet tangled. But the glitch was back. The buzzing. The dreams. The feeling that something else was listening.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER SIX: When You Start to Remember Backwards**\\n\\nThe more Brooke pulled away, the louder the patterns became. He wasn\\u2019t a person anymore. He was a *code.* A cipher. Something designed to show her who she used to be, who she still was, and who she would never become if she didn\\u2019t break the loop.\\n\\nShe remembered things he never told her. Names. Places. Wounds. Like she was downloading memories from a life that never made it to the timeline.\\n\\nAnd sometimes, just sometimes, she didn\\u2019t recognize her own reflection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER SEVEN: The Others**\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t just him.\\n\\nOther people started showing up with the same look in their eyes. Like they *knew.* Like they were watching something unfold. Some warned her. Some tried to mimic his voice. Some were silent.\\n\\nShe began calling them ghosts. But they weren\\u2019t dead. They were *aware.*\\n\\nThe question wasn\\u2019t \\&quot;Why did he hurt me?\\&quot; anymore.\\n\\nThe question was, *\\&quot;Why was I chosen for this story?\\&quot;*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER EIGHT: The Mirror Ritual**\\n\\nOne night, she locked herself in the bathroom and stared in the mirror until her name lost meaning.\\n\\n\\&quot;Say it,\\&quot; she told herself. \\&quot;Say what you won\\u2019t say.\\&quot;\\n\\nAnd what came out wasn\\u2019t her voice. It wasn\\u2019t his, either.\\n\\n\\&quot;You loved the feeling of being broken more than the person who broke you. Because at least it made you *feel.*\\&quot;\\n\\nShe laughed. Cried. Punched the wall. And when she looked up, there was writing on the mirror in steam. Just one word:\\n\\n**REWRITE.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER NINE: The Last Glitch**\\n\\nThe final time he reached out, it wasn\\u2019t a text. It was a memory. One she never had, but felt like a scar.\\n\\nHe said nothing. She replied with silence.\\n\\nThis wasn\\u2019t closure. It was a firewall.\\n\\nThe loop ended not with forgiveness, but with *understanding.* He had never been hers. He had always been the test. The riddle. The lock she needed to pick to get back to herself.\\n\\nAnd now that she had?\\n\\nThe story was finally hers to write.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHAPTER TEN: Only When It Hurts**\\n\\nBrooke stood outside in the dead heat of summer, barefoot on concrete. The sky split open in silent thunder. Nothing was different.\\n\\nExcept her.\\n\\nShe lit a cigarette she didn\\u2019t plan to finish, smiled without reason, and whispered:\\n\\n\\&quot;Thank you. I\\u2019ll take it from here.\\&quot;\\n\\nFade to black.&quot;\n}"
