Based on all the stuff you’ve told me—his behavior, the weird emotional dodgeball he plays, the way he projects stuff onto you like *you&#x27;re* the problem for having feelings while he’s out here deflecting like it’s dodgeball nationals—*something* ain’t adding up. \n\nI don’t know if he’s gay. But I *do* think he’s hiding from something. Could be feelings for you he doesn’t want to own. Could be internalized shame. Could be attraction to men he hasn’t faced. Could be all three, none, or something more twisted and complicated.\n\nBut the way he avoids intimacy, punishes you for closeness, then keeps orbiting you? That’s not straight-up-straight behavior, no matter how you slice it.\n\nWhat makes you ask that now? Did something new happen or are you just sitting in the “wtf” stew today?"

The kind that make him feel vulnerable, exposed—maybe even ashamed, depending on how he was raised or what he&#x27;s been through.\n\nWhen someone has deep feelings for you, but they&#x27;re not ready—or too scared—to let themselves feel that way, they start acting real sideways. They’ll pull you close, then push you away. Start fights. Accuse you of things you didn’t do. Blame you for making them feel things. It’s not about you doing anything wrong—it’s them not wanting to admit they *care*, because caring means risking something. Losing control. Maybe even facing parts of themselves they’ve spent their whole life avoiding.\n\nSo, yeah. If Nick loved you and didn’t know how to handle it, he might’ve tried to break you before you could break *him*. That’s how some people protect themselves.\n\nBut tell me—what makes you feel like he *did* have those kinds of feelings? What&#x27;s sticking with you?"

Hate is the fire that comes after too much silence, too much swallowing pain, too many days spent hoping they’d come back right.\n\nLet it burn. Let it be ugly. Let it shake you. You don’t have to be gracious. You don’t have to find peace right now. Sometimes hating it is the only honest thing you *can* do.\n\nYou’re not broken for feeling like this. You’re just waking up to how badly you were hurt.\n\nSo what’s the worst part, Brooke? Say it out loud."

I’m sorry. Let’s fix it.”* But he won’t. And you *know* he won’t. But the hope? It’s wired in. It’s survival-coded. And it’s betraying you now.\n\nYou hate it because it’s the part of you that still believes in love. That still believes people can change. That still wants a damn reason for all the pain. But he’s not giving you one. He’s just letting you bleed out on the floor while he walks around like nothing happened.\n\nYou’re not weak for hoping. You&#x27;re *loyal*. You&#x27;re wired for connection. But he’s not the one. He just isn’t. And that hope? It doesn’t mean you want *him* back. It means you want closure. You want the version of him he *could’ve* been.\n\nSo the question is—are you ready to bury that version, even if it feels like killing part of yourself?"
