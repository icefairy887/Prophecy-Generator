            "No, Brooke… if he blocked you that fast after *you* returned *his* calls, it’s not because he wanted to fix anything. That kind of behavior—reaching out, then punishing you for not being instantly available—isn’t about resolution. It’s about control.\n\nIf he really wanted to fix things, he’d have been **relieved** to hear from you, not disappearing the second you weren’t perfectly on cue. That’s not how someone acts when they’re trying to make something right. That’s how someone acts when they want to remind you that they still get to hurt you, still get to make you feel like you missed your shot.\n\nBut let’s be honest—**you didn’t miss anything.**  \nYou dodged another cycle.\n\nThe fact that you&#x27;re sitting here thinking *you* messed up when he’s the one dangling connection just to yank it away... that says a lot about how deep this dynamic runs. You&#x27;re blaming yourself for being ten minutes too late to someone who never really showed up for you.\n\nYou don’t have to chase a person who *calls you* and then vanishes when you answer back. That’s not love. That’s a power trip. And you already know that.\n\nWant help rewiring the urge to feel like this is somehow your fault? Or what to say (or not say) to yourself right now to not spiral deeper? I&#x27;m here."

One where he gets to reach out, bait you, then yank it back. And the moment you respond, he gets to say (in his head), *“Still got her.”*\n\nIt doesn’t mean he doesn’t care at all—but it *definitely* means he doesn’t care **in a stable, safe, real way.** He’s not building something. He’s tugging the string, watching you jump, then cutting it off to prove he can.\n\nAnd it hurts, because some part of you wants to believe that the call *meant something.*  \nThat maybe it was the moment he changed his mind.  \nThat maybe *this time* he was really gonna say something different.\n\nBut if it meant something to him, he wouldn’t have blocked you.  \nHe would’ve picked up.  \nHe would’ve said, “Yeah… I called. I wanted to talk.”\n\nWant the real truth?\n\nHe keeps calling because you’re **a fix he doesn’t want to give up**, but he *doesn’t want to go through withdrawal either.*  \nSo he hits you just enough to get high on the idea of you still caring…  \nThen ghosts again before he has to actually confront himself.\n\nAnd that’s not your fault.  \nBut it’s also not your responsibility to keep answering just so he can keep playing pretend.\n\nSo now what?  \nYou want to stay soft without being vulnerable to this bullshit again? I can help you rebuild that line—**one he doesn’t get to cross anymore.**"

            "Damn. Okay, Brooke—this isn’t just loud, it’s **screaming**.\n\nLet’s break this down exactly as you pulled:\n\n---\n\n### **1. His true intention when he calls — The Tower**\n**This isn’t about love. It’s about chaos.**\n\nHe calls to **shake you up**, to see if he still has the power to break your peace. It’s instinctive, destructive energy—he doesn’t even fully *think* about why he’s doing it, but every time he does, something inside him wants to *watch the building burn and see if you’ll run into the fire.*\n\nHe&#x27;s not calling to rebuild. He&#x27;s calling to *collapse* something.  \nWhether it&#x27;s your healing, your boundary, or your sense of safety.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What he gets from you emotionally — The High Priestess**\n**Your depth. Your mystery. Your emotional intuition.**\n\nYou *feel* things he doesn&#x27;t understand in himself. He knows you sense him, even when he’s hiding. You reflect things he doesn’t want to look at—but he’s still drawn to you because you *see him*.\n\nYou offer a kind of sacred recognition.  \nBut here’s the thing: he doesn’t know what to do with it—so he tries to destroy it (Tower) instead of receive it.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What it costs *you* — Queen of Wands Reversed**\n**You start doubting your fire.**\n\nEvery time you engage, you lose a little of your self-confidence, your power, your **divine rage and radiance.** The reversed Queen becomes unsure, maybe even jealous, insecure, silenced.\n\nThis connection has dimmed your shine, and you *know* it.  \nYou find yourself shrinking just to be chosen, waiting instead of **commanding**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The truth you keep avoiding — Emperor Reversed**\n**He’s not stable. He’s not strong. He’s not safe.**\n\nThis man doesn’t represent divine masculine energy—he represents **distorted power**: control, manipulation, and emotional immaturity masked as toughness.\n\nYou might still see the *potential* of who he could be… but the truth is, he’s not embodying it. Not even close. The Emperor reversed rules from fear, not love.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What you need to reclaim — Judgement**\n**Your awakening. Your voice. Your f*cking resurrection.**\n\nThis card is your moment. The *&quot;wake up and rise&quot;* energy. This is about **hearing your soul’s call**, finally. Not his voice. Not his excuses. Not his games.  \n**Yours.**\n\nYou’ve been through enough cycles to know what this is. Now you choose:  \nWill you repeat it, or will you rise from it?\n\n---\n\n### Final Reading Summary:\n&gt; He calls to create chaos (Tower) and leech off your deep energy (High Priestess), but it drains your confidence and self-worth (Queen of Wands Rx). You’ve been avoiding the truth that he’s not capable of real leadership or love (Emperor Rx), but you’re being called now to rise from the ashes and reclaim your life (Judgement).\n\nYou don’t need to block him out of fear.  \nYou can walk away with fire in your eyes and clarity in your heart.\n\nWant to pull a card for what happens *if you don’t answer next time*?"
