            "Alright, babe. Sit down, light something, stare at a wall if you have to—I&#x27;m tuning in.\n\nYou’re walking into *Nick’s house*, which is not just a building but a thicket of old ghosts doing the tango on broken glass. Don’t pretend this is neutral territory—it’s not. It’s a goddamn emotional hazard zone with nice lighting. And yet, here you are, thinking maybe this time it’ll just be chill. Cute.\n\nSo let’s slice this open right. The **right expectations**? Expect **ambivalence wearing a smile**. Expect that he might be glad to see you, and also wish he didn’t care. Expect that whatever warmth he gives could just be the heat coming off unresolved crap under the floorboards. Don’t read into the tea he makes you, or the way his voice gets soft at night. That’s muscle memory. That’s not commitment—it’s ghost sex. Emotional phantom limb stuff.\n\nAlso, remember this: *you don’t owe him your softness just because you once did.* Bring your full self—jagged, glowing, aware. If you laugh, let it be real. If it hurts, notice it. You don’t have to hide your sensors just to be &quot;cool&quot; around him. That’s a fool’s spell. You’re not here to be palatable. You’re here to be **present**, even if it’s uncomfortable.\n\nNow, is there a specific vibe you’re worried might go sideways? Or something he does that throws you into that spiral? Give me more to chew on."

You just wanna go in and be **yourself** without twisting into a circus pretzel trying to calibrate to someone else’s static. That’s holy. That’s sacred. And it’s also *fucking hard* when there’s old heat and history humming through the walls like a busted fluorescent light.\n\nHere’s the deal: you don’t have to expect **nothing**—that’s not realistic, that’s repression cosplay. What you want is to expect *only what’s yours*. You bring your vibe, your timing, your messy-but-honest self, and let that be the compass. If he matches it? Great. If he doesn&#x27;t? Still great—you stayed intact.\n\nThe trick is this: **don’t audition for the version of you he used to like.** Don’t shrink into who he remembers. You’ve got new layers now, don’t shelve ‘em just to make nostalgia comfortable.\n\nAnd baby, *being yourself* in his house might feel weird at first. Like wearing boots in a place you used to tiptoe. But do it anyway. Take up space. Let silence be awkward if it needs to. Let him see the new frequency you&#x27;re riding. That’s the whole point.\n\nDo you know what version of you tends to show up there? The one you slip into without meaning to?"

She’s waiting, she&#x27;s careful, she&#x27;s full of unsent letters and clenched hope. And she’s **so tired**, isn’t she?\n\nOkay. Let’s unfuck this.\n\nYou want to connect. Deeply. Not fake, not polite, not “how’s work.” And that’s not desperate, that’s human. But when you&#x27;ve already spilled your whole history across ten thousand conversations, trying to reach him again can feel like clawing at wallpaper hoping there’s a door behind it. So here’s what you do:\n\nYou stop trying to *find* new things to say, and you start showing him who you are *now*. You speak from this exact you—the raw, scarred, wired, wide-open version that *isn’t looking for permission anymore*. Let the conversation be about **what you&#x27;re thinking today**, even if it’s stupid or messy or “too much.” Talk about your weird dreams, your last meltdown, your newest obsession. Ask him about **now**, not his curated life summary. Be curious like you just met him, not like you’re trying to win him.\n\nAnd when you feel that achey-ass urge to go quiet and hope he picks you? Notice it. Don’t shame it—she’s part of you—but don’t give her the mic.\n\nWant me to channel what a real, grounded convo might sound like with him? Or what to do if he gives you nothing back?"

            "Alright, channel’s open. Here’s what it might look like—what it *could* sound like when you walk in and you decide, “No more ghost-speak, no more shrinking.”\n\nYou sit down. Maybe he offers you something. Whatever. Let that be neutral. You say something like:\n\n&gt; “I almost didn’t come. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I didn’t wanna show up as that version of me that’s always half-waiting for you to like me back.”\n\nJust throw it on the table. No drama, just fact. Say it like you’re noticing the weather.\n\nThen maybe:\n\n&gt; “I’m trying this thing where I don’t perform for people I care about. It’s harder than it sounds.”\n\nAnd if he bites, if he looks at you like you just cracked open the real, then yeah—you go there. Talk about *you now*. Things you’re afraid of. Stuff that makes you laugh lately. What’s been waking you up at three a.m.\n\nAnd if he doesn’t bite—if he gets awkward or pulls into that emotional fortress—don’t scramble. Just sit in it. Be like:\n\n&gt; “You don’t have to have the right thing to say. I’m just not interested in pretending right now.”\n\nYou’re not there to extract connection like a tooth. You’re there to offer it. If he meets you in that? Beautiful. If not? You’ll walk out knowing you didn’t bend your soul into origami trying to be palatable.\n\nWant a few more specific convo threads to throw out if the silence gets weird? Or something to say when that old ache creeps up mid-sentence?"
