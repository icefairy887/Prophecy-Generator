That would tell us if it’s you, FB itself, or someone else.  \n\nWant me to do that?"

That’s a repeating pattern every few days. It looks more like a script, sync process, or outside access cycling the status.  \n\nIf you want, I can walk you through **pulling your full Facebook activity log export** and isolating the unfollow events with:  \n- Exact timestamps (down to the second)  \n- The IP addresses and devices that did it  \n\nThat way we’ll know if it’s happening from your phone, your computer, or somewhere else entirely.  \n\nDo you want me to dig into that?

            "Then this whole list makes even less sense —  \nbecause if he was **blocked** from July 15 onward, Facebook shouldn’t even be able to *unfollow* or *follow* him.  \nBlocking already cuts the follow connection automatically, and you can’t re-follow someone while they’re blocked.  \n\nSo if:  \n- You blocked him on **July 15**  \n- Kept him blocked for at least a week (which covers July 29 &amp; July 30’s entries)  \n- And still have “unfollowed” logs during that time…  \n\nThat means those later entries **weren’t triggered by you** in any normal user action.  \nIt’s either:  \n1. **A Facebook log bug** – It’s logging “unfollow” as part of backend sync even though you were blocked.  \n2. **Account automation or external control** – Something toggling that follow status *before* or *after* block without your consent.  \n3. **Delayed log injection** – Facebook sometimes processes old queued actions later and drops them into your activity feed out of order, making it look like they happened during the block period.  \n\nIf we dig into your **raw activity log export** from Facebook, we can confirm whether those July 29–30 entries are *timestamped with the moment you see them* or if they’re actually older actions that got re-stamped when the system caught up.  \n\nIf the timestamps in the raw log match the days they appear here, then something actually hit your account during the block. If they’re older but showing up late, that points to a log corruption/glitch.  \n\nI can show you exactly how to pull and filter that export so we see which it is.  \nDo you want me to set that up so we can check if these “unfollows” really happened while he was blocked?"

            "Alright — here’s how we’ll catch whether these “unfollow” logs are real actions or just Facebook ghost entries.  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 1 – Request Your Full Facebook Data Archive**\n1. On your phone or desktop, go to: **[https://www.facebook.com/dyi](https://www.facebook.com/dyi)**  \n2. Under **Select information to download**, check ONLY:  \n   - **Activity log**  \n   - **Security and login information** (important for device/IP tracking)  \n3. Set **Date Range** → **All time** (so we can see everything leading up to and during the weird dates).  \n4. Set **Format** → **JSON** (not HTML — JSON keeps the raw event data and source info).  \n5. Click **Create File** and wait for Facebook to finish preparing it (can take a few minutes to hours).  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 2 – Get the File Onto a Device Where We Can Search**\nOnce Facebook sends you the download link:  \n- Download the `.zip`  \n- Extract it (unzip) somewhere you can browse files — Chromebook, PC, or even Termux on your phone.  \n\nInside, you’ll see folders like:  \n```\nactivity_log/\nsecurity_and_login_information/\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3 – Isolate the “Unfollow” Entries**\nIn the `activity_log` folder:  \n- Open the `connections.json` (or sometimes `connections_and_followers.json`) file.  \n- Search for `&quot;unfollowed&quot;` and look for entries mentioning **Nicholas Alexander Plafcan**.  \n\nEach entry should have:  \n```json\n{\n  &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1753939200,\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;You unfollowed Nicholas Alexander Plafcan.&quot;,\n  &quot;data&quot;: {\n    &quot;ip_address&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,\n    &quot;user_agent&quot;: &quot;...&quot;,\n    &quot;source&quot;: &quot;...&quot;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe **`timestamp`** here is the *real* internal time (in Unix epoch format) the action happened — not what Facebook shows in the UI.  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 4 – Match With Device/IP Logs**\nIn the `security_and_login_information` folder:  \n- Open `login_activity.json` or `recent_logins.json`  \n- Find the matching timestamps.  \n- See which **IP address**, **location**, and **device** was active at the moment the “unfollow” happened.  \n\n---\n\n## **Step 5 – What This Will Tell Us**\n- If the **timestamp** is during deactivation or block → Facebook is doing this on its own (ghost process).  \n- If the **timestamp** is *older* than the UI date → This is just a delayed log entry.  \n- If the IP/device isn’t yours → Someone else is in your account.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, once you grab that archive I can give you **exact Termux/Chromebook commands** to filter *only* the Nicholas-related unfollow events and cross-match them with login IPs in one shot. That’ll give you a neat forensic table of when, where, and how it happened.  \n\nDo you want me to prep that search script for when you get the file?"
