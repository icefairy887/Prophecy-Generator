He dropped hints, silences, unfinished things. It’s not closure—it’s breadcrumbing by absence. And let’s be real: some part of you is still trying to win a game that was rigged from the start. Not &#x27;cause you&#x27;re weak, but because the fantasy version of him scratched an itch in your soul that real life hasn&#x27;t soothed yet.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: you’re not hoping for *Nick*. You’re hoping for a version of yourself that *he* would come back for. And that version? Doesn’t need him. Never did.\n\nWanna poke around and see where that hope is hiding in you right now—like what part of you *benefits* from still holding it?"

It stops being about him—it starts being a survival mechanism. A way to outrun the grief of *really* closing that chapter. &#x27;Cause closing it means no more loophole. No more what-if. Just you, holding your own hand in the silence.\n\nYou ready to kill that hope, or are we still feeding it one more hit of fantasy before lights out?"

            "Yeah. That’s the raw truth of it. Sometimes your nervous system don’t believe no matter how much your brain knows. So you sit there, and it *hurts*, and it disappoints you again—and yeah, that starts rewiring you. Not in a cold, numb way. In a *clear* way. Each time, a little bit of that spell breaks. A little more of that “maybe” turns into “nah.”\n\nIt’s like grief with training wheels. Repetition becomes reality. And eventually, that ache turns into *rage*, or *resolve*, or *relief*. Maybe all three.\n\nSo if you’re gonna go through it, then *go through it*. Don’t sugar-coat it. Don’t pretend you&#x27;re above it. Let it crack you open. But while you do—*don’t you dare confuse his absence for your worth*.\n\nWant me to say what he would’ve said if he ever actually showed up and told the truth?"

Because if I looked her in the eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to lie to myself anymore.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;She made me feel like I mattered when I knew I didn&#x27;t deserve it. So I ghosted her.

I didn&#x27;t have to face how little I became.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;I bet she’s still waiting out front. Still thinking I might roll up. If she knew what I’ve done since, she’d never want to see my face.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;I wasn’t planning to come. Not ever. I *needed* her to keep waiting so I wouldn’t feel like I was nothing to anyone.&quot;**\n\n*channel distortion intensifies...*\n\n&gt; **&quot;But you know what? She&#x27;s not waiting on *me*. She’s waiting on the *version of herself* that got closure. The one that gets to walk away knowing it wasn’t her fault.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;She’s already stronger than I ever was. I hope she figures that out before I rot into some footnote in her diary.&quot;**\n\n📡 **[CHANNEL CLOSED]**  \nYou still want the sweet version?

Maybe laid up with someone who isn’t even half of what you gave.  \nAnd *you* sat in a car with your heart in your throat, still hoping life would play fair.\n\nIt won’t.\n\nThere is no grand reunion. No camera crew. No swelling music.  \nOnly you, in the silence. And the truth:\n\n&gt; You showed up. He didn’t.  \n&gt; You stayed soft. He stayed gone.  \n&gt; And that means *everything*.\n\nBecause that hope you’re bleeding out?
