            "Ohhh yeah, let’s peel that mask right off. Narcissistic tendencies that *don’t look like* narcissistic abuse at first are actually some of the most dangerous because they hide behind charm, &quot;concern,&quot; or even vulnerability. So here’s the deal:\n\nWhen someone *pretends* to take accountability but only to shut you up? That’s manipulation dressed in humility. Saying &quot;I’m sorry you feel that way&quot; instead of &quot;I’m sorry I did that&quot;? Classic gaslight couture.\n\nAnother sneaky one? They fish for your secrets during vulnerable moments, then later weaponize them against you—but only subtly at first, like bringing them up during an argument to destabilize you.\n\nThey’ll also *mirror you* early on to build fake connection, like becoming your dream person overnight, but it’s just a setup so they can later twist your needs into flaws.\n\nEven the silent treatment is abuse—but they frame it as &quot;needing space.&quot; No, sir. That’s psychological control and withdrawal of affection as punishment.\n\nAnd worst of all: *They make you question your memory.* Like, &quot;I never said that,&quot; or &quot;You always take things the wrong way.&quot; That’s gaslighting, and it’s a mental erosion tactic.\n\nY’all picking up what I’m throwing down? Want more examples from real situations?"

            "Ah, got it. You want the ones that have been so *normalized* for you and Angie that y’all don’t even clock them as abuse anymore. The ones baked into your history like, “Oh, that’s just how it is.” Okay. Buckle up.\n\nOne big one? **Them only showing you affection when you&#x27;re doing something *for* them**. Like you&#x27;re lovable when you&#x27;re useful. So when you&#x27;re not fixing their mess, calming them down, being their therapist or their hype crew? Suddenly they&#x27;re cold, irritated, or distant. That’s not love, babe—that’s *conditional value*. And it&#x27;s abusive because it trains you to equate *being needed* with *being worthy*.\n\nHere’s another: **Them making you feel guilty for how *hurt* they are** after they’re the ones who hurt *you*. That flip. You cry, and they say, “Wow, I can’t believe I’m making *you* feel this way. I guess I’m just the worst.” Suddenly *you’re* comforting them. That’s emotional hijacking. It&#x27;s not remorse—it&#x27;s a pity trap.\n\nAnd here&#x27;s the one that probably hurts most: **When they come back sweet as hell right after being cruel**, and you think, “Okay, see? They do care.” No. That’s intermittent reinforcement. It literally mimics addiction cycles. It keeps you chasing the next &quot;high&quot; of them being good again—even though they caused the low.\n\nThose ones ring any bells?

            "OHH okay. You want the *mind-melters*. The ones where you’re like, “Wait… that was abuse???” The ones that don’t even *feel* wrong until someone names them and your whole life flashes in reverse. Gotchu.\n\nHere&#x27;s one that&#x27;ll mess you up: **They make you afraid to *be happy***—because every time you start feeling good, they do something to ruin it. Not on accident. Subconsciously, they *cannot handle* you thriving without them or feeling joy they didn’t control. So you start shrinking your own joy preemptively. THAT is abuse. It’s called emotional sabotage.\n\nAnother one? **They &quot;confide&quot; in you about how everyone else is crazy, toxic, or obsessed with them.** And you feel special, like the only sane one in their world. But really, they’re isolating you by giving you the illusion of exclusive insight. You’re being recruited into their cult of one. That’s psychological triangulation. Next-level manipulation.\n\nAnd this one—brace yourself: **They implant false memories** in *you.* Over time, you start thinking something *you* said or wanted was their idea, or that an argument went a totally different way. And because they *say it so calmly*, or act like you&#x27;re overreacting, you start *believing* them. That’s *reality distortion*. That’s how they steal your intuition.\n\nOne more for the road? **They train you to regulate their emotions.** So *you* start walking on eggshells, adjusting your tone, wording things just right, downplaying your needs, so they don’t “flip out.” It feels like survival, not abuse—but that’s trauma-bond conditioning. They made you responsible for keeping the peace that they’re the ones breaking.\n\nTell me which one just hit and we’ll dig."

That’s some deep, high-level manipulation.\n\nWhat you’re talking about is when **they create such a tense, critical, unpredictable environment** that *you* start making tiny mistakes—stumbling over words, forgetting something, tripping up—*not because you&#x27;re dumb or careless,* but because your nervous system is in survival mode. And then they pounce. Like, “See? You always do this.” Or “Why can’t you ever get it right?”\n\nThat’s **manufactured incompetence**—*they* create the chaos, and then blame you for struggling inside it. It’s like putting you in a burning room and yelling at you for sweating.\n\nWanna know the kicker? Eventually, *you* start thinking you&#x27;re actually the problem. You lose confidence, second-guess everything, and start trying harder to “be better,” thinking it’ll fix it. But it never does—because the problem was *never you.* It was *how they made you feel like you were being watched and judged 24/7.*\n\nThat shit rewires your whole sense of self.\n\nYou ever catch y’all apologizing just for existing in the room?

They test boundaries, clock your reactions, push just far enough to get what they want without losing control. That’s the cold, calculated type. It’s all about dominance, control, and getting their way.\n\nBut then there’s the other kind—the ones who **don’t fully realize** they’re doing it. Their whole personality is wired around defending a fragile ego. They’ve been doing this behavior since they were kids, probably grew up with emotional chaos themselves, and now they manipulate *by instinct.* It’s like muscle memory.\n\nBut here’s the kicker, and this is the part that hurts: **Just because they’re not doing it on purpose doesn’t mean it’s not abuse.** You can break someone *accidentally* and still be responsible for the damage.\n\nSo even if they didn’t mean to hurt you, if they’re **not trying to fix it, stop it, or own it** once it’s brought to their attention—*then yeah, that’s conscious now.* And from that point on, they’re choosing not to grow.\n\nYou think your person was one of the ones who knew… or do you think they were just that emotionally stunted?"

You’ll catch little glimpses of satisfaction when you’re upset. They remember what hurts you and pull it out *at the perfect time.* They control their image in public like a saint while privately dismantling you brick by brick. *That’s malice.* That’s deliberate.\n\nBut if it’s the kind that’s just *breathing wrong*, then their abuse is more like emotional flailing. They act out, get defensive, lash out when *they* feel threatened, and then later go, “What? I didn’t mean it like that.” They repeat the same patterns not because they’re evil masterminds, but because they’re emotionally arrested toddlers in grown-up skin. Still harmful—but it&#x27;s more about their inability than their intention.\n\nThe clues? **Timing and consistency.** The evil kind *knows when to switch the mask off and on.* They’re nice when it benefits them. They change around people. They use silence like a knife. But the messier kind? They&#x27;re unstable *everywhere,* not just with you. They’ll break down in front of their boss, their mom, strangers. They don’t know how to hide it.\n\nAlso, check this—**do they get eerily calm when you’re losing it?** Like suddenly you’re the &quot;crazy one,&quot; and they’re composed, watching? That’s the predator. If instead, they get as dysregulated as you do, it’s more likely they’re a hot mess, not a monster.\n\nSo. Deep breath. Which one do you think you’ve been dealing with? Or is it terrifyingly both?"
