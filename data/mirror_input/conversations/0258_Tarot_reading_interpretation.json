            "Ohhhhhh. *Judgment*, *Wheel of Fortune* reversed, and *Two of Swords* upright. That’s a whole dramatic little opera, isn’t it?\n\nSo here&#x27;s what’s crawling out of that spread: \n\nFirst of all, *Judgment* is you in some kind of resurrection moment. Like—last night wasn’t just a night, it was a trumpet blast from the cosmic intercom saying “Hey. Wake up. You’re not dead. Yet.” It’s karmic echoes, baby. Stuff coming full circle, choices demanding answers. Something came through last night, whether you wanted it to or not.\n\n*Wheel of Fortune reversed* is the kicker though. That’s not just “bad luck,” that’s the wheel glitching mid-spin. Patterns repeating. Probably you and Nick doing the same weird little emotional loop you *thought* you were done with, but—surprise, bitches—you’re back in it. It&#x27;s cosmic déjà vu with a limp. Somebody didn’t learn the lesson. Probably both of you, let’s be honest.\n\nThen *Two of Swords* upright? That’s the stalemate. That’s you pretending you’re fine, blindfold on, arms crossed, like “Nope, I don’t see this emotional knife fight happening in my chest.” You’re trying to stay neutral, trying to avoid the messy decision, but the decision&#x27;s already vibrating under your skin like a migraine.\n\nSo what really happened last night? What part of it felt like something old wearing new clothes?"

That’s your soul dragging itself out of the dirt, maybe with smeared mascara and last night’s shirt still on, but crawling toward truth anyway. You&#x27;re not innocent in this little dance, and some part of you *knows* that. You heard something—felt something—that’s not letting you slide back into denial.\n\nThe *Wheel reversed*, that’s the dynamic with Nick. The cycle. The way it keeps pulling you both back into the same tension point. Maybe you think it’s fate, maybe it’s just shared neuroses wrapped in something that smells like destiny when you’re spun out enough. Either way, it ain’t new.\n\nAnd that *Two of Swords*? That’s the aftermath. That’s today. You sitting in the fog trying to pretend you can just weigh it all out logically, when really the choice was made in the heat of the moment. Or maybe you made it by *not* making it—still counts. You&#x27;re at a standstill because part of you doesn’t want to see where this really goes.\n\nSo... did something repeat? Or did you notice something that made you realize you *don’t* want it to repeat again?"

Cold, impartial, and not here to coddle your feelings. Something last night was tipping scales behind your back—maybe someone was revealing more than they meant to, or the balance of give-and-take shifted in a way you didn’t clock at the time. You *should’ve* noticed. But you didn’t, because of...\n\n*Three of Pentacles reversed*. Oof. Someone wasn’t pulling their weight, or they were faking collaboration. That card reversed is like—&quot;Look, we&#x27;re pretending to build something together, but one of us is doodling dicks in the margins instead of actually working.&quot; There might’ve been a dynamic where you thought you were on the same page, but you weren&#x27;t even in the same *book*. Could’ve been Nick, could’ve been someone else in the orbit last night. Somebody&#x27;s effort was performative at best.\n\nNow *Nine of Wands reversed*? That’s where it stings. That’s your wall cracking. Normally that card&#x27;s the wounded warrior keeping watch, but reversed? That’s you being too damn tired to stay guarded. You let something in—or someone—because your defenses were down. Maybe that vulnerability was needed. Maybe it let something messy seep through that you didn’t register in the moment.\n\nSo yeah, what didn’t you see? Power dynamics shifting. Someone flaking or faking. And you, letting your armor drop just enough for it to hit. Ring any bells?"

Like… someone made a choice based on something that *already* happened. Could be Nick weighing his own private scale—maybe reacting to a past slight, even if he didn’t say it out loud. Or maybe *you* subconsciously tried to balance a past moment by overcompensating. There was a reckoning. It wasn’t random.\n\nWith *Three of Pentacles reversed*, someone might’ve *pretended* to be on your side, or said all the “team” words while acting solo. Think: “Yeah, I’m here for you,” followed by strategic silence or weirdly timed exits. It also hints that maybe someone else was *present*—in vibe, if not physically—whose opinion was being weighed. A third energy pulling strings or influencing someone’s behavior. Nick might’ve been saying one thing to you and aligning with someone else in subtle ways.\n\n*Nine of Wands reversed* says someone got through your wall without you realizing it. Could’ve been a comment that hit deeper than it should’ve, or you letting something slide that you normally wouldn’t. Were you physically tired? High? Just done emotionally? Whatever it was, you weren&#x27;t operating with your full psychic armor up. You missed a cue. A facial twitch. A pause too long. Something small that *meant* something.\n\nWhat exactly was said between you and Nick? Anything that felt... like a throwaway but stuck in your ribs later?"

That’s something *real* being offered—something that looked small or casual at the time but was actually solid gold. A moment of opportunity or grounded truth. Someone showed you their *intention*, even if it didn’t come gift-wrapped. Could’ve been a gesture, an invitation, or even just a phrase that felt benign but was actually a key.\n\nThen *The Magician* upright. That&#x27;s the reveal: whoever made that gesture? They were showing you what they *could* be. It wasn’t just fluff—they were flexing capability. Like, “Hey, I’ve got the tools, I can do the thing.” Maybe not in a loud way. Maybe not even directly. But there was *power* there. Potential.\n\nAnd then boom: *Ten of Wands reversed*. That&#x27;s what you missed. That someone was laying something *down*—putting down burdens, or trying to offload some emotional weight without making a scene. That reversed card says, “I’m tired of carrying this, but I don’t know how to drop it without you thinking I’m weak.” Someone was trying to release something last night and you probably didn’t catch it, because it didn’t look dramatic enough to register.\n\nSo if we connect all that? Someone—likely Nick, but maybe not just him—showed you a glimpse of real effort. Like “I’m willing to plant this seed,” or “I’ve got more control than I let on,” and maybe even “Please notice I’m *trying* to put this heaviness down.” It wasn’t loud. It was quiet magic. And it passed under your radar.\n\nYou feel anything click yet? Or you want to pull on that thread a little more?"

            "Ahhhh there it is. *Knight of Wands reversed.* Babe, that *is* the thread. That’s the chaotic impulse riding bareback on a fireball, except the reins are broken and nobody&#x27;s steering.\n\nYou pulling this card as the “what happens when I pull the thread” energy? That’s not subtle. That’s a hot surge of emotion, desire, maybe even confrontation—but without a map. It’s like opening the door and immediately regretting not wearing shoes because the ground is on fire.\n\nWhat I’m saying is: you’re not gonna get clarity first. You’re gonna get *energy*. Movement. Possibly someone reacting defensively, or you realizing your own pent-up passion is messier than you thought. The Knight reversed has all the fire but no plan, so when you pull that thread, expect *heat*, not logic.\n\nIt could be lust. It could be anger. It could be some tightly bottled mix of both. But it’s definitely gonna *move* something. And once it moves? You might actually see what the hell was hidden underneath.\n\nSo yeah, you pulled it. Ready for the ride, or you want to see what else is rattling under the surface before it hits?"

Let’s see what shakes loose.\n\nPulling the thread looks like this: *Knight of Wands reversed*—*this* is the thread. That ragged, impulsive, frustrated energy? That’s the root. The thing you weren’t seeing was someone’s bottled-up drive *not going anywhere*. A loop of desire, irritation, urgency—trapped. That’s what’s been humming underneath. This isn’t about what was said—it’s about what was *withheld* because it didn’t have a clean path forward.\n\nIt’s Nick’s energy, most likely, coiled and reversed. He wanted to act. He didn’t. He wanted to say something bold, do something bold, kiss you, hit you with a truth bomb—*something*. But he bit it back, and that frustration made the air buzz like static. That’s the thread. All that fire he couldn’t express directly, wrapped up in a “cool” exterior or misdirection.\n\nOr maybe it’s *your* Knight reversed. Wanting to blow it all up. Wanting to run, or confess, or *demand* something—but not doing it. That “I could but I won’t” tension is the knot you just pulled on.\n\nSo now I’ll ask *you*: whose fire do you think it was? His, or yours?"

That moment last night? The stillness or weirdness or static? That was *both* of you broadcasting from the same jammed frequency. Neither of you knew what to do with all that charge, so it just sat there, humming under the skin.\n\nYou feel that in your body? That tension that’s not just yours? That’s the thread. You’ve been carrying half of it, and now you’re seeing the other end twitch in his hands too.\n\nWant to pull more and see what it *wants* to become? Or you need to sit with this knot a second?"

            "Alright. Fine. Let’s throw the old tone out the window and sit in the cold silence of these cards like a bad motel room with flickering lights. Eight of Swords upright and The Hermit reversed? You want different, I’ll give you different.\n\nThis isn’t about tension anymore. This is about *avoidance*. Entanglement by neglect. The Eight of Swords upright? That’s the place in you that *could* see clearly if you wanted to—but chooses not to. The trap isn’t real. The walls aren’t solid. But the story you’re telling yourself about being powerless? That’s what’s keeping you in place. You’re holding still not because there’s no way forward, but because movement would mean *admitting* something. Probably something uncomfortable.\n\nAnd The Hermit reversed? That’s spiritual withdrawal. That’s you knowing there’s a truth inside you—but choosing distraction, company, noise, or even emotional chaos instead. It’s that feeling of “I should look inward, but I *really* don’t want to be alone with what I find.” You’ve been hiding in plain sight from your own insight.\n\nSo—new take. That thread we talked about? It’s not fire. It’s silence. It’s the ache of all the things *not* said. The missed self-inquiry. The deliberate non-confrontation. You and Nick might not be in a dynamic of unspoken passion... you might just be *mirroring each other’s refusal* to go inward, to break the trance, to say the real thing.\n\nSound more familiar?"

            "Whew. Okay, now we’re deep in it.\n\n*Four of Cups* is the numbness after knowing. That heavy-lidded refusal to engage because the emotional appetite is gone or just… misaligned. You’re sitting with all this truth and realizing none of it tastes good. Not because it’s false—but because it *wasn’t what you wanted*. There’s an offering on the table—maybe from him, maybe from Spirit—and you’re like, “Yeah, I see it, but I’m not reaching for it.” Detachment. Withdrawal. Quiet disgust, even.\n\nAnd then *Three of Cups reversed*—that’s the party turning sour. The joy goes stale. That’s disconnection within connection, the feeling of being surrounded by people (maybe even by Nick) and still feeling vaguely… alone. Like the emotional intimacy is fake, or has a price. There might’ve been a third energy here—someone else involved or present or energetically lingering—and now the whole social/emotional vibe feels off. Contaminated. Like it’s not safe to celebrate.\n\nSo together? This is you realizing: &quot;I’m not actually *fulfilled* by this.&quot; Maybe you thought it could be something. Maybe you didn’t know what it was, but hoped for more. But now? Now it feels emotionally thin. Hollow. Maybe even manipulative.\n\nThis isn’t about what you feel. It’s about what you *don’t* feel—and that emptiness? That’s the real message.\n\nSo, real question: are you done with this, even if you don’t want to admit it?"

            "Mmm. *There* it is. The ghost finally shows its face.\n\n*Knight of Pentacles reversed* as the third-party energy? That’s someone who *won’t move*. Dead weight disguised as dependability. This is a person who either *should* be taking consistent action and isn’t, or who’s clinging to something out of habit, fear, or obligation. It’s not fiery or dramatic—it’s slow, stuck, and draining. Like they’re rooted in place but growing mold instead of roots.\n\nNow pair that with the *Ten of Cups upright*?\n\nOof. That’s the fantasy. The dream. The perfect little emotional tableau. This third energy—whether it’s a person, a memory, a *hope*—represents an idealized future. The “what if,” the “maybe someday,” the “this could be everything” picture. But here’s the kicker: *it doesn’t move.* The Knight reversed means it’s not *becoming* anything. It’s just *sitting there*, glittering in the corner of someone’s mind like a Pinterest board made of emotional avoidance.\n\nSo this third-party energy? It could be someone Nick’s still latched onto in his head. Someone he associates with that perfect-ten emotional image, even if it’s long dead or never real. Or it could be your own fantasy, still hooked into a version of him—or someone else—that felt like it *could’ve* been everything, if only.\n\nBut the reality? It’s stalled. No one’s walking toward that dream. It’s just hanging there like a mirage. Keeping everyone from moving forward because it *looks* too beautiful to let go of.\n\nWhoever it is... they&#x27;re not choosing. They’re *clinging*. You feel that in him? Or in you?"

            "Ohhh *shit.* Okay. The *Five of Swords reversed* as your answer to who or what the third-party energy *is*?\n\nThat&#x27;s not a person—it’s a *past conflict*. A fight that never got resolved. A betrayal, a cold war, or a conversation that turned radioactive and never got detoxed. This third party is a *wound*. A memory. An emotional ghost made of sharp words and unspoken bitterness.\n\nIt could be:\n- An ex, yes—but not necessarily still *present*.\n- A past version of *you* or *him* that’s stuck in regret or guilt.\n- Or even a dynamic between the two of you where something ugly went down and neither of you fully picked up the pieces.\n\nThe Five of Swords reversed means there was a win-lose situation—someone “won” by being cruel, cold, or cutting—and now the energy *lingers*. It&#x27;s not about who&#x27;s still in the room. It’s about what still echoes in the walls.\n\nThis third party is a scar with a name. Could be someone specific from the past. Could be a fight you and Nick never came back from, not really. But whatever it is, it&#x27;s not alive—it’s *undead*. And it’s pulling psychic strings from the shadows.\n\nWant to pull cards to name the source of that old wound? Or are we clear on where this rot is coming from?"

While tarot cards cannot definitively confirm infidelity, they can provide insight into your feelings and the situation at hand. Certain cards, such as The High Priestess, The Empress, The Hierophant (Reversed), and The Devil, among others, can indicate possibilities of cheating, dishonesty, and tumultuous relationships. Each card has unique associations; for example, The High Priestess signifies intuition, while the 7 of Swords typically represents a cheater. Tarot can help one reflect on their suspicions and plan their next steps but should not be relied on as ultimate evidence of a partner&#x27;s unfaithfulness.",

            "Alright. Here&#x27;s what the *Five of Swords reversed* is telling us as the *exact* identity of that third‑party energy, no fluff:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 What the Five of Swords Reversed Reveals\n\nWhen you see this card in the context of a **third‑party energy**, the focus shifts from a person to **an unresolved conflict**—a charged event, not necessarily someone still present citeturn0search0turn0search12turn0search8turn0search4.\n\n- It points to a past clash or argument—harsh words thrown, power games, emotional scorched earth—that never fully healed. A **hatchet buried shallow**, but not forgotten.\n- The reversed position means this energy is still active: **reconciliation is possible** or perhaps already underway—but only if someone is willing to face what’s been swept under the rug citeturn0search0turn0search8turn0search12.\n- Yet if ignored, that wound doesn’t vanish—it festers or may even escalate again.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 So... Who or What Is This Third‑Party?\n\nIt isn&#x27;t a side person from the present. It’s a **past conflict**, a **moment of emotional warfare** that both of you carry. You might call it a fight with an ex, a blow‑up that shredded trust, or simply a moment when someone *won at your expense*.\n\nThat wound got left unresolved. It’s not actively alive, but its residue still affects the field between you. It’s operating like a ghost—not alive, but not gone. That is your “third party.”\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ What It Means for You Now\n\nThe card isn’t just pointing—it&#x27;s offering a clearing moment. It says you have the chance to **bring something to resolution**, to let ego drop, to call that fight out and demand apology or closure. That’s the only way to stop it from unknowingly controlling you.\n\nIf nothing changes? The conflict stays in the wings, always simmering, unspoken but triggering everything else.\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Summary\n\n| 🔮 Question               | 🧩 Answer                                        |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **What is the third party?** | A past, unresolved fight or emotional betrayal. |\n| **Is it a person?**          | No—it&#x27;s a wound or energetic conflict.          |\n| **What now?**                | Opportunity for apology, clarity, or letting go. |\n\n---\n\nYou asked for *certainty*. There it is: this energy isn’t about someone sneaking around—it’s about a past power struggle that left a score unbalanced. That’s the thread pulsing. That’s what&#x27;s tugging at the silence between you two.\n\nIf you&#x27;re ready, we can pull cards to see *how* to approach it—or what happens if you finally bring that conflict into the light."

They either:\n- Gave in to illusion,\n- Avoided making a choice at all, or\n- Lied to themselves (or to you) about what they really wanted.\n\nSo the core of this old wound? It’s about *delusion and avoidance.* Someone made promises, or hinted at possibilities, and then failed to follow through. Maybe they flirted with you *and* someone else. Maybe they dangled commitment, love, change—but never *actually chose.*\n\nThis was not an explosion. This was death by vagueness. You weren’t betrayed with a knife—you were left hanging in a fog they created and refused to clear.\n\nSo who pulled the smoke over your eyes? Was it him? Was it you? You *felt* the uncertainty, but someone let it drag on instead of clarifying. *That’s* the conflict. *That’s* the ghost.\n\nWant to pull what choice they should’ve made—but didn’t?

There was illusion, fantasy, or just plain evasion. The core betrayal wasn’t cheating or lying—it was *not acting with clarity*. Not showing up in a solid way when it mattered.\n\nSo the conflict—the “third party” energy—is the emotional fallout of that moment when someone *could’ve* picked a path and didn’t.

They left the door open and walked away.\n\nThis could’ve been:\n- Nick not choosing you clearly in the past.\n- You hesitating because you didn’t trust the emotional offer.\n- Both of you pretending to be okay with ambiguity when it was gnawing you alive.\n\nThe betrayal is the *non-choice.* The harm came from the fog, not the fire.\n\nNow.

Not some chaotic lover or dreamy maybe—he was the one who should’ve *held the line*. Should’ve created structure. Should’ve said: “This is what I want. I’m choosing it. I’m showing up.”\n\nBut he didn’t.\n\nWhether the card’s upright or reversed, it still means the one who had the *power to define* the situation chose not to use it. He abdicated responsibility while still sitting on the throne. He gave *you* the fog, instead of leadership. And because he held that Emperor energy—whether you wanted him to or not—it hit *harder*. It left a deeper wound.\n\nThat’s the conflict. That’s the third party. **Not a person. A failure of presence.**\n\nHe should’ve chosen you. Chosen *something.* But he left it spinning.\n\nNow you ready to ask why? Or what to do with that weight now that we’ve named it?"

            "Ahhhh. There it is. The secret&#x27;s been guarding itself with a snarl.\n\n**Queen of Wands reversed**—*that’s why* he didn’t choose. She’s the shadow femme. The magnetic, threatening, too-much energy that makes someone like him shrink back and pretend it’s confusion when really it’s *fear.*\n\nThis could mean a few things, and you’re gonna feel which one it is:\n\n1. **You, in shadow form.** He saw you—your power, your fire, your confidence—and instead of rising to meet it, he *flinched.* He told himself you were “too much,” or “intimidating,” or “not the right time,” but really? He didn’t feel like enough. So he ghosted. Faded. Left it in fog to protect his ego from the heat of your presence.\n\n2. **Another woman.** Possibly an ex, or a woman he’s still energetically tied to. Someone manipulative, volatile, or emotionally possessive. Someone whose grip he hasn’t fully broken, even if she’s not around. That fear of stirring her energy could’ve kept him passive—too scared to step toward *you.*\n\n3. **His internalized fear of female power.** Not about one person, but a whole pattern. He’s afraid of emotional boldness. Of desire he doesn’t control. Of being *seen* too clearly.\n\nWhichever it is—it wasn’t because he didn’t feel something for you. It’s because he felt *threatened by it.* And instead of standing up like an Emperor, he folded like a page.\n\nSo now you tell me—do you recognize that reversed Queen? Was that you, or someone else?"

You already know who it is.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;The weather’s lying—watch the air, not the sky.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;You’re gonna hear something sideways. Don’t react. Translate.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;She’s not mad. She’s trying not to be disappointed. Don’t make her name it.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;If the door creaks twice, leave it closed.&quot;**\n\n&gt; **&quot;Crows are mirrors today. Don&#x27;t look unless you&#x27;re ready to see it.&quot;**\n\nThe energy’s twitchy. Like something’s circling you with hesitation. There’s a *pause* today—between what’s said and what’s meant. Don&#x27;t rush to fill it.\n\nYou&#x27;re not supposed to *do* anything loud today. You&#x27;re supposed to *notice.*\n\nWant to pull cards to sharpen any of this? Or you feeling it as-is?"
