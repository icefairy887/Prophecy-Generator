            "You&#x27;re carrying so much right now. The weight of the world, it feels like. You&#x27;re trying *so hard* with so little, and it’s not fair. It&#x27;s not fair that you have to do this alone. It&#x27;s not fair that you&#x27;re expected to keep it all together when everything inside you feels like it’s falling apart. And it&#x27;s definitely not fair that you don&#x27;t have someone—just one damn person—to say, *“Hey, I’ve got you. You’re doing enough.”*\n\nBut let me say this clearly: **you are not fucking your kids up.** You are showing up. Even when you&#x27;re exhausted, in pain, out of money, full of doubt—you are still *showing up*. That matters. That’s love, in its rawest form.\n\nIt’s okay to hate all of this right now. It’s okay to feel like it’s too much. You&#x27;re not bad or broken for struggling. You’re human. You’re overwhelmed. And honestly? Anyone would be. You’re doing the work of three people without a support net, and somehow still worrying about your kids having a good time at this damn art thing.\n\nIf I could be there, I would go with you. I’d stand next to you so you didn’t have to feel alone. I’d bring snacks, sit on the floor if we had to, and I’d remind you every five minutes that no one’s looking at you with judgment—they’re probably just trying to survive too.\n\nYou don’t have mange. You’re tired. You’re worn thin. But you are still here. You are *not* a burden.\n\nDo you want help figuring out what to do with the $25 to stretch it a little? Or maybe some ideas for how to make this art thing more manageable? Or do you just want to sit in this for a minute and not have to fix anything?"

Where even your own reflection feels like another thing to hate. I’ve got you in this, though. You’re not alone right now.\n\nYou say you look like shit—but what I see is someone who&#x27;s *survived*. Who’s probably been through hell and is still fucking *standing*. Maybe barely, maybe shaking, but still *showing up* for your kids. That doesn’t look like shit to me. That looks like *courage in crisis*.\n\nThis spiral you&#x27;re in—it’s real, and it’s cruel, and it lies. It tells you you’re broken, ugly, worthless, failing. But here’s the truth: that voice in your head is just pain talking. Pain lies. Pain distorts. And the fact that you’re still fighting through it—even if it’s messy, even if it feels like you’re losing—means you are *not done yet*.\n\nYou’re not stuck forever, even if it feels like it now. You’re in a storm. But the storm *is not you.* It’s around you. It will pass. And until it does, I’ll sit with you in it.\n\nWhat’s the next thing you *have* to do? Like, the next tiny move?

            "Okay—here’s how to do emergency cry repair. Fast and dirty, no judgment, just survival mode:\n\n### 1. **Cold water, if you can**\n- Splash cold water on your face if you can—especially around the eyes. Or even just soak a paper towel and press it against your eyes for a minute.\n- If you can’t do that, grab something cold—ice, frozen veggies, whatever—and hold it gently against your face. It’ll reduce swelling and redness.\n\n### 2. **Eye drops (if you have them)**\n- If you’ve got any eye drops—even just saline—it helps flush out the redness.\n\n### 3. **Makeup triage (if you wear any)**\n- If you have concealer, dab it under your eyes. Use your finger to tap it in, not rub.\n- Even if you don’t have makeup: **use a warm-ish damp cloth** to blend out any smudging or streaks.\n\n### 4. **Elevate your look with one quick move**\n- Sunglasses if you have them.\n- Hair up and off your face in a ponytail or clip.\n- A hoodie or jacket with a hood—makes you feel more “contained,” protected.\n- Lip balm or a little something on your lips—just to give your face one point that feels intentional.\n\n### 5. **Reset your face**\n- Tilt your head down and breathe deep—slow exhale through your mouth like you’re sighing.\n- Blink slowly a few times. Let your eyes dry a little.\n- If your eyelids are swollen, gently press the flat part of your fingers over them for a moment.\n\nAnd here’s a big one: **you don’t have to look perfect.** You just have to look *there*. People won’t see “crying.” They’ll see a parent showing up for their kids. Even if your eyes are red. Even if your face feels tight.\n\nYou’ve got this. One step at a time. Want to run through what to bring or say to the kids before you go? I can help you armor up."
