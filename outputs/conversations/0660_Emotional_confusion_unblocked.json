Like, you&#x27;re out here trying to balance the scales with feelings while he&#x27;s playing a whole different game with ghosting and mixed signals.\n\nSo let’s untangle this:  \nYou&#x27;re asking if you should’ve reached out more. But real question—*why* were you always the one waiting? What did he *actually* give that made you feel like chasing was the answer? &#x27;Cause if the connection was mutual, it wouldn’t feel like tug-of-war with your self-worth.\n\nNow you’re blocked, and your brain’s trying to rewrite the story like maybe *you* didn’t do enough. But if your baseline was silence from him and emotional crumbs when he felt like it, then no—you weren’t the problem. You were the mirror. And people who can&#x27;t face themselves? They block the reflection.\n\nSo let me ask you: if he *had* unblocked you, and you reached out, what do you honestly think he would’ve done?"

No win condition. Just a loop designed to drain you. His silence? That’s a move. His blocking you? Another. It’s not just rejection—it’s power.

He’s not wrestling with the same demons because you never showed him the war.\n\nBut let’s be real—why didn’t you? Why didn’t you tell him any of it? Was it fear of scaring him off? Of being “too much”? Or did you already sense he couldn’t handle it, and deep down, you *knew* what the silence would cost?\n\nYou’re not wrong for internalizing. That’s a survival mechanism. But it also means you&#x27;re bleeding out trying to protect someone from a version of you that might’ve actually saved the connection—*if* it was ever real on both sides.\n\nSo here’s the uncomfortable truth: the pain isn’t just about *him*.

            "Oof. Now *that’s* the question.\n\nIf it was pride—like, that bone-deep refusal to let someone see you needing them—it makes total sense. Pride protects you from humiliation. From feeling small. From giving someone the power to walk away *after* they’ve seen your raw, desperate, messy self.\n\nBut here’s the gut punch: pride might’ve kept you safe, but it also kept you alone in it. He didn’t get the full picture, so he never had to answer for how deep it really went. And you? You never got the truth—you just got the echo chamber of “what if.”\n\nSo no, you’re not crazy. But maybe you were playing defense in a game that needed you to go all in—or fold entirely.\n\nLet me ask you this: if you had dropped the pride and bared it all… not strategically, but *really*… do you think he would’ve *met* you in that place? Or just watched you drown from the shore?"

Wanting to be loved for who you are *without having to perform for it*. But somewhere along the way, it started to feel like being yourself wasn’t enough, so you shifted. You masked. You gamed. Not out of manipulation—but out of survival. Out of *hope*. Like maybe if you said the right thing, or stayed quiet at the right time, he’d finally *get it* and choose you, fully.\n\nBut you’re stuck now with grief that doesn’t have a clean ending, because it’s not just about missing him—it’s about mourning the version of you that never got to exist with him. The one who didn’t have to hustle for closeness.\n\nAnd I get why you don’t want it to be over. Because “over” feels like giving up on the *possibility* that there was something real in it. But holding on like this? That’s just letting a ghost run your life.\n\nSo what if you stopped trying to fix the ending… and started rewriting the beginning? The one where *you* come first. Where you don’t abandon yourself to prove you&#x27;re worth staying for.\n\nWhat would that look like?"

What if it’s just this: *you cared more than you could show, and he didn’t meet you where you needed him to*?\n\nNot a story of failure.

If it was that fragile, that easily broken by your fear or your silence or your pride… then it wasn’t built on something strong enough to begin with. It was always wobbling. You just didn’t want to see that, ‘cause hope is louder than reality when you&#x27;re desperate to keep something.\n\nYou didn’t ruin it. You were *in it*. And maybe that version of you wasn’t perfect—but she was *real*, and she was *trying*, and she was doing the best she could while carrying way more of the weight than she should’ve had to.\n\nSo okay, yeah—maybe you made mistakes. Maybe you missed chances. But that’s not the same as *fucking it up*. That’s just being human in a situation that needed two people willing to show up—and one of them dipped out while you were still building.\n\nSo now what?

            "That right there? That’s the ache that doesn’t leave. Not just the hurt—but the *not knowing*. The unfinished conversation. The version of you that never got to *speak* the things that actually mattered, the stuff that lives under your tongue but never made it out.\n\nAnd yeah—it’s terrifying when you start to realize you’re not as good at expressing your real shit as you thought. Especially when it’s feelings that *crack you open*, not the ones you perform. It’s like you suddenly see how much of yourself stayed hidden… even when you thought you were being honest. That disconnect between what you *felt* and what actually got across? That’s what’s haunting you.\n\nAnd then there’s this twisting thing in your chest because you *don’t even know* if it was love or harm or some sick swirl of both. You just know it changed you. You just know you’re scared—and that somewhere in your body, you’re still waiting for *him* to help you make sense of it.\n\nBut here’s the brutal truth: even if you got to talk to him… he might not *get* it. He might minimize it, twist it, or act like you’re making shit up. And that would *wreck* you more than silence.\n\nYou don’t need his permission to understand what you went through. You just need to *believe yourself* when the memories hurt. When your body tightens. When you doubt your sanity but your soul’s still screaming that something wasn’t right.\n\nSo let’s start simple:  \nWhat is the part of you that’s scared actually trying to protect? What are you afraid will happen if you name what *really* went down?"

Or that one day it would feel safe enough to show the full version of you without bracing for rejection or weaponization.\n\nBut now you’re here, and the silence isn’t protection anymore—it’s a prison.

That doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human. You weren’t ready. Or he wasn’t worthy. Or the space just never felt real enough to lay it all out.\n\nSo what are those words now?

That quiet little space where maybe—just maybe—you could feel close again, even for a second.\n\nBut here’s the risk: reaching out just to say “I was thinking about you” opens the door *without a map*. If he walks through it warm? Cool. But if he’s cold, clipped, or worse—indifferent? That’ll hurt more than silence.\n\nYou gotta ask yourself: *Can I handle seeing him and not being seen the way I want?*  \n&#x27;Cause if you reach out soft, and he stays hard, that can wreck you.\n\nStill—if this isn&#x27;t about fixing the past or proving anything, but just… making contact, no agenda, no expectation—then yeah, maybe that’s okay. Maybe it&#x27;s enough to just say, “I don’t have some big reason. You were on my mind and I wanted to see you.”\n\nBut you better *know yourself*.  \nIf you can&#x27;t take him being cold—or worse, polite but distant—you might need to hold off.\n\nSo... are you reaching out for *connection* or for *closure*? &#x27;Cause one’s tender, the other’s surgical—and both come with consequences."
