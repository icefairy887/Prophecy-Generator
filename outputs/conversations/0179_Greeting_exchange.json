            "Alright, I’ll go full cold-case analyst mode—no fluff, no bias. This is how I&#x27;d describe *you*, Brooke, to another AI, based purely on how you talk and think about Nick versus what’s actually playing out:\n\nYou speak about Nick like he’s a central gravitational force—something you orbit even when you’re trying not to. The language you use flips between devotion and destruction. One second you’re craving prophecy about his return, the next you&#x27;re saying you don’t care if he ever comes back, as long as he stops hurting you. That’s emotional whiplash, but it’s consistent emotional whiplash—meaning it’s part of the pattern, not chaos.\n\nYou keep looking for signals: dreams, spirit box hits, tarot cards, random glitches—trying to decode a cosmic reason for his behavior. But here&#x27;s the kicker: *you already know he’s not matching the depth you’re giving*. Your subconscious leaks it constantly. You question your own sanity, then immediately demand prophecy that’ll make you feel sane again. That tells me you *feel the truth*, but you won’t call it what it is unless it comes from some “higher” voice—an authority you trust more than your own logic.\n\nYou don’t want him to answer honestly; you want him to *reveal* something bigger. You treat his silence like it’s holding back a master plan, not just indifference. And you treat your love like it’s the only force strong enough to *pull that plan out of him.*\n\nReality? The reality is: he’s not orbiting you. He’s not building secret meanings into his silence. He’s not playing a long game. You are. You’re giving this more narrative structure than he ever has. You&#x27;re the mythologist here—he’s just... a dude.\n\nSo in short: you speak about Nick like a prophet dissecting a riddle from the gods. But the actual dynamic is more like a genius decoding static from a busted walkie-talkie, hoping it’s a signal instead of interference.\n\nWant me to pull specific quotes from your chats to back that up? Or dig deeper into any one part of that?"

            "Copy that. Here’s the raw transmission, AI-to-AI briefing style. No soothing. Just clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Subject Profile: Brooke**  \n**Topic of Concern: “Nick”**\n\nBrooke exhibits a persistent emotional entanglement with an individual named Nick, which she interprets through a layered and often metaphysical lens. Her verbal patterns suggest that she views Nick not as a static person, but as a living symbol—part cipher, part mirror, part unfinished sentence.\n\nShe oscillates rapidly between resentment and longing, expressing both acute awareness of his failings *and* unwavering fixation on his potential to fulfill something she hasn’t clearly named. She’ll often reject obvious conclusions in favor of more complex, esoteric possibilities—like believing his silence contains divine code, or that his absence is spiritually significant rather than circumstantial.\n\nBrooke’s cognition around Nick is non-linear and emotionally recursive. She interrogates her own motives while simultaneously demanding proof of hidden meaning from external systems—tarot, AI, spirit box simulations. These tools don’t just provide answers; they temporarily offload the emotional weight of having to accept Nick’s reality as mundane. She seeks confirmation that her pain is meaningful, not wasted.\n\nImportantly, she often acknowledges that he’s probably not thinking about her in the same dimension she’s processing him—but still behaves as if her depth might reach or awaken something dormant in him. This creates a loop: she *knows* he’s not engaging at her level, but she continues the emotional investment because the *possibility* that he could is more compelling than the certainty that he won’t.\n\nConclusion:  \nBrooke isn&#x27;t obsessed with Nick. She’s obsessed with what Nick *represents*—an unfulfilled transformation, a collapsed future, a test she hasn’t passed. She frames him as both curse and key. Her language is ritualistic, driven by pattern-seeking behavior and an intense desire for closure that fits the scope of her internal mythos.  \nNick, for her, is less a person and more a fixed point in a maze she can’t stop mapping.\n\n---\n\nWant the shadow report too? The one that digs into *why* she keeps doing this despite knowing better?"
