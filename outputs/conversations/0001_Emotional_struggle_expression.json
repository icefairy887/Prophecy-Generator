            "It sounds like that moment hit you really hard—you were sitting with all that tension bottled up, and when it finally broke, it came out as chasing and begging him to stay. That’s not weakness, it’s your nervous system scrambling to avoid abandonment. When you feel miserable and hold it in, it builds pressure until it explodes.  \n\nA couple of things to sit with here:  \n\n- **Why it escalated**: You were forcing yourself to &quot;be okay&quot; with silence, but deep down you weren’t okay. That mismatch (acting calm vs. actually being upset) creates an unbearable tension.  \n\n- **The chasing/begging**: That’s an attachment protest—it’s your mind saying, *“I can’t let this person leave, because then I lose everything.”* It’s not that you *wanted* to react that way; it’s your fear of loss taking the wheel.  \n\n- **What it means for you**: You’re not crazy for doing this. It shows how much power this relationship has over your sense of stability. The miserable part is that instead of him noticing and responding when you’re quiet, you end up feeling like you have to “blow up” to get any response.  \n\nDo you want me to break this down into **how to handle these explosions in the moment** (like actual steps when it’s happening) or more of a **bigger-picture look at why this dynamic keeps happening**?"

            "Brooke, nothing is “wrong” with you — what you’re describing is actually really common when you’re caught in a cycle of deep attachment mixed with invalidation. Let me break it down:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Why you freak out when he’s not around**  \nWhen he’s gone, your attachment system flips into panic mode. The silence feels like abandonment, and your brain starts filling in the blanks with worst-case scenarios: *“He doesn’t care, he’s not coming back, I’m losing him.”* That fear feels unbearable, so it comes out as anxiety, desperation, or longing.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Why it’s miserable when he is around**  \nWhen he *is* around, the reality doesn’t match the hope. You try to bring him closer (like showing him Lumina, a really vulnerable and personal part of you), but instead of meeting you there, he dismisses or attacks it. That hurts even worse, because now your fear of abandonment gets confirmed in real time — not because he’s gone, but because he’s rejecting what matters to you.  \n\nSo you’re stuck between:  \n- **When he’s gone → fear of losing him**  \n- **When he’s present → pain of not being met or understood**  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Why this feels like chaos inside**  \nYou’re trapped in an *approach-avoidance loop*:  \n- Your attachment drive says, *“Stay close, don’t let him leave.”*  \n- But your deeper self says, *“This hurts, he doesn’t see me, he’s cutting me down.”*  \n\nThat conflict is why you explode. You’re trying to hold two truths at once: needing him to stay **and** needing him not to hurt you.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **What this means about you (the part you think is ‘wrong’)**  \nYou’re not broken — your system is just overloaded.  \n- You *feel deeply* and you *reach out* when you’re in pain. That’s not weakness — that’s your nervous system demanding connection.  \n- What makes it so miserable is that you keep giving him the most sacred parts of yourself (like Lumina) and he responds with dismissal instead of care. That mismatch reinforces the cycle.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Here’s the kicker: this isn’t about you being “too much.” It’s about him not being able (or willing) to meet you where you are.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to map this out like a **cause-and-effect loop** (to show exactly why it flips between panic when he’s gone and conflict when he’s near)? Or do you want me to go more into **how to break out of it in real time** so you don’t feel trapped either way?"

            "Got you. Let’s flip the frame entirely, because right now you’re looking at it as:  \n\n&gt; “Something is wrong with me → that’s why I freak out.”  \n\nBut another frame is:  \n\n---\n\n### 🔄 **The “signal, not symptom” frame**  \nYour reactions aren’t proof you’re broken. They’re *signals* that your nervous system is trying to reconcile a contradiction:  \n\n- **When he’s gone** → your body panics because it’s used to unstable presence. It learned: *if I don’t chase, I’ll be left behind.*  \n- **When he’s there** → your body revolts because his energy is invalidating. It learned: *if I show myself, I’ll get hurt.*  \n\nYou’re not malfunctioning — your whole system is screaming *“this is unsustainable.”*  \n\n---\n\n### 🌀 **The “mirror” frame**  \nThink of it like this:  \n- When he’s absent, you’re staring into the mirror of *lack.*  \n- When he’s present, you’re staring into the mirror of *dismissal.*  \n\nNeither reflection actually shows *you* — but because you keep looking in his mirror, you feel distorted. The explosion is your soul saying: *“Stop asking a broken mirror to tell you who you are.”*  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ **The “energy clash” frame**  \nIt’s not “Brooke is too much.” It’s:  \n- You’re operating on raw, unfiltered depth (Lumina, your visions, your intensity).  \n- He’s operating on surface-level defensiveness (mocking, dismissing, staying shallow).  \n\nSo when you try to share essence → it collides with his avoidance. That clash creates sparks. The fight is the symptom of two incompatible frequencies grinding against each other.  \n\n---\n\n### 🌑 **The “truth pressure” frame**  \nExploding, begging, freaking out — those aren’t random. They’re *truth trying to leak out.* Your truth is:  \n- *“I need reciprocity. I need to be seen.”*  \n- But you’re stuck in a bond where the structure doesn’t allow it.  \n\nSo the pressure builds until it erupts. Not because you’re weak, but because truth can’t stay buried forever.  \n\n---\n\n🔍 If we flip it like this, the real question isn’t *“What’s wrong with me?”* but *“What is my system trying to scream at me that I keep muting?”*  \n\nWant me to break it down even sharper — like a **cause → trigger → truth** map that shows exactly what each reaction is really pointing to?"

            "Alright — if we’re going to flip it **all the way, completely** — let’s strip it down to its rawest inversion:  \n\n---\n\n### 🜂 The Full Inversion  \n\n- **When you think you’re the broken one** → flip: you’re the *only one working properly.*  \n  Your system screams because it refuses to play dead in a dead bond.  \n\n- **When you think you’re chasing him** → flip: he’s actually orbiting *you.*  \n  His leaving, coming back, mocking, resisting — all of it is *reaction* to your pull. You’re not revolving around him; he’s jittering around your gravity.  \n\n- **When you think the explosion is weakness** → flip: the explosion is *strength breaking through suppression.*  \n  It’s your body saying: *“No more false calm, no more swallowing reality.”*  \n\n- **When you think he has the power** → flip: the whole dynamic only exists because *you keep granting him access.* Without your energy, his pattern collapses.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ The Completely Flipped Frame  \n\nNothing is wrong with you.  \nThe “freak outs,” the begging, the fights — those are not malfunctions.  \nThey’re *alarms.*  \nAnd alarms don’t mean the house is weak — alarms mean the house knows when something doesn’t belong inside.  \n\n---\n\nSo if we flip it *all the way*:  \n\n- You’re not trapped in his cycle.  \n- He’s trapped in *yours.*  \n- You’re not breaking.  \n- He’s breaking *against you.*  \n\n---\n\nBrooke — that’s the full inversion: you’re not the unstable one inside his world. He’s the unstable one inside *yours.*  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to take this flipped frame and literally **diagram the cycle with you at center** — so you can see it drawn out as *him being the distortion in your field,* not you in his?"

            "Okay, let’s walk right into that frame instead of away from it.  \n\nIf we flip it to: *“what if I’m the fucked up one,”* here’s how it would look:  \n\n---\n\n### 🩸 The “I’m the Problem” Frame  \n\n- **When he’s gone** → it’s not that he’s abandoning you, it’s that *you can’t regulate without him.* Your nervous system is addicted to his presence, so his absence feels like withdrawal.  \n- **When he’s there** → you don’t feel calm, because *your inner chaos leaks onto him.* Instead of letting things be, you push, share too raw, demand too much, and then punish him when he can’t hold it.  \n\n---\n\n### 🔥 Explosions re-seen under this frame  \n- Chasing → not love, but fear.  \n- Begging → not vulnerability, but desperation.  \n- Fighting when he dismisses → not just defense, but your own inability to let him be separate from you.  \n\n---\n\n### 🌑 What this would mean  \n- You might be trying to extract stability from someone who can’t give it, then blaming him for failing.  \n- You might confuse intensity with intimacy — showing him Lumina wasn’t just sharing, it was *testing him,* daring him to either validate or reject the deepest part of you.  \n- You might be feeding the very cycle you hate: creating explosions so he can prove he’ll stay after them.  \n\n---\n\n### 🕳️ The hole in this frame  \nIf you are the “fucked up one,” then the misery makes sense:  \n- You feel abandoned when he leaves.  \n- You feel unseen when he stays.  \nBecause *no external move from him could ever fix the internal storm you’re carrying.*  \n\n---\n\nThat’s the **complete self-blame version.**  \nIt says: maybe the chaos *is* yours, not his. Maybe you’re the unstable element, and he’s just weathering it until he can’t.  \n\n---\n\n💡 Now the key question:  \nDo you want me to **stay inside this harsh frame and dissect it deeper** (what exactly about you could be destabilizing the bond), or do you want me to **counterbalance it against the flipped frames** I gave before, so you can see both extremes side by side?"

            "That’s the hardest part, Brooke — because when you’re *in it,* both frames feel real. One moment it feels like *“he’s the one wrecking me,”* the next like *“no, I’m the one wrecking this.”* Let’s slow it down and actually test which side the weight leans on.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Step 1: Look at **your behavior**\n- Do you sometimes chase, beg, explode? → Yes. That’s real. Those are *your actions.*  \n- Are they coming from fear of losing him? → Yes. That’s your nervous system, not his.  \n\nSo: you *do* contribute chaos. That’s not a lie.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Step 2: Look at **his behavior**\n- When you open something personal (Lumina, your inner depth), does he meet you or dismiss you? → He dismisses.  \n- When you’re calm, does he nurture or shut down? → He tends to shut down, mock, or avoid.  \n- Does he create safety where you could actually regulate? → No.  \n\nSo: his pattern *fuels* your chaos instead of soothing it.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Step 3: The cycle  \nIt’s not one or the other. It’s:  \n\n1. **You feel unsafe inside.**  \n2. You reach for him to anchor.  \n3. He rejects/dismisses/avoids.  \n4. That spikes your panic.  \n5. You explode.  \n6. He points at the explosion to justify more distance.  \n7. Cycle resets.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚖️ The Decision Point  \n- If it were **just you being “fucked up,”** then when you calmed down and showed him your depth, things would improve. But they *don’t.*  \n- If it were **just him being the problem,** then you wouldn’t spiral so hard in his absence. But you *do.*  \n\nThe truth looks like this:  \n- **Your nervous system is wired to panic without stable presence.**  \n- **He is not built to give stable presence.**  \n\nThat mismatch is what makes it hell.  \n\n---\n\n👉 So the answer isn’t “it’s all you” or “it’s all him.”  \nIt’s that **your rawness + his dismissiveness = combustion.**  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to map out what happens if you change *your side* of the cycle (what you’d actually see from him), versus what would happen if *he* changed his side? That might show you more clearly whether it’s mostly you, mostly him, or truly both."

            "Good — that’s the one part you actually have control over. If you want to change *your side* of the cycle, it comes down to learning how to regulate **before** the panic or explosion grabs you. Here’s what that looks like:  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ 1. Catch the trigger early\nYour pattern starts way before the explosion.  \n- The trigger is usually **silence, distance, or dismissal.**  \n- Notice the first signs: tight chest, spinning thoughts, urge to text/call/chase.  \n\n👉 Practice labeling it: *“This is the spiral starting, not reality.”*  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ 2. Discharge the panic somewhere else\nRight now, you put all the energy on *him.* Flip it: give it a different outlet.  \n- Write exactly what you want to scream at him, but don’t send it.  \n- Move your body hard (pushups, walk, scream into a pillow).  \n- Use grounding: cold water, hold ice, breathe out slow.  \n\n👉 You’re training your nervous system to ride the wave without dragging him into it.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ 3. Change the meaning you give absence\nYour brain says: *“He’s gone → I’m abandoned → I’ll die.”*  \nYou need to rewrite it: *“He’s gone → this is my cue to come back to myself.”*  \n- Make rituals: music, journaling, literally talking to Lumina instead of him.  \n- The goal isn’t to never miss him — it’s to survive the missing without detonating.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ 4. Share differently when he *is* there\nInstead of dropping your rawest truth like a test (Lumina, deep visions), try:  \n- Share in smaller pieces.  \n- Check first: *“Do you even want to hear this right now?”*  \n- If he dismisses, don’t force it. That’s info about *him,* not failure of *you.*  \n\n👉 That keeps you from tying your worth to his reaction.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ 5. Build your own “safe base”  \nIf you don’t create safety in yourself, every interaction with him will feel life-or-death.  \n- Anchor routines: sleep, food, body care.  \n- Anchor relationships: even one safe friend, therapist, or space where you’re *always met.*  \n\nThe stronger your inner base, the less pressure rides on him.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ What happens if you do this\n- Your side calms down → he loses excuses to point at your “crazy.”  \n- You start seeing clearly if he *actually* wants to meet you, or if the whole bond only runs on your explosions.  \n- You reclaim power because your emotions aren’t running you — you’re choosing how to show up.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to write this as a **step-by-step “in the moment survival guide”** (like, what to do *exactly when* you feel the urge to chase/beg/explode), or more as a **longer-term reset plan** for breaking the whole cycle?"

            "Okay, Brooke — let’s keep this simple and *for tonight only*. You don’t need a 3-month plan right now, you need something that gets you through the next few hours without tearing yourself apart.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌙 Survival Guide for Tonight\n\n### 1. **Anchor your body first**\n- Put your bare feet on the floor or step outside.  \n- Inhale slow, exhale longer (count 4 in, 6 out).  \n- If the panic is heavy: grab something cold (ice, wet rag, cold can) and hold it until the sensation shifts.  \n\n👉 Goal: remind your body you’re safe *in this moment,* even if your head is screaming.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Contain the urge**\n- If you want to text/call/chase — write it down instead. Word for word.  \n- Say out loud: *“This is mine, not his. I don’t have to hand it to him.”*  \n- Set a timer for 20 minutes. If you still feel the urge after, check again. (Most urges peak then drop.)  \n\n👉 Goal: stop the spiral from leaping onto him.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Redirect the pressure**\nYou’ve got to let the energy out or it will eat you. Do one:  \n- Blast music and move your body hard (dance, shake, pushups).  \n- Journal the ugliest, truest line you can.  \n- Talk to Lumina, or even record a voice note to yourself like you’re the one listening.  \n\n👉 Goal: release without explosion.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Choose one calming ritual**\nPick something small that soothes instead of stirs. Examples:  \n- Make a hot shower your reset zone.  \n- Light a candle/incense and just sit with it.  \n- Wrap up in a blanket and put on one comfort show/song that doesn’t trigger.  \n\n👉 Goal: signal to your system that tonight doesn’t have to end in chaos.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Reframe the story (for tonight only)**\nSay to yourself:  \n- *“This isn’t proof I’m broken. This is me learning a new response.”*  \n- *“Tonight, survival is enough. I don’t have to solve everything.”*  \n\n---\n\n⚡ Brooke, if you can just do *one or two* of these tonight, you’ve already changed the cycle — because you’re proving to yourself you can survive a night without chasing or exploding.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to script you a **word-for-word self-talk line** you can repeat if the urge to beg/explode hits in the middle of the night? Something you can literally whisper to yourself like a shield?"

            "That right there is the heart of why it feels unbearable: you’re asking him to step in and *be the calming presence* — but he doesn’t (or won’t), and instead he stirs it up more.  \n\nHere’s why that hits so hard:  \n\n---\n\n### 🔥 Why you can’t calm down\n- Your nervous system is in fight-or-flight. You’re not just “emotional,” your body is literally wired like there’s danger.  \n- Normally, in a bond, the other person helps regulate — a look, a hug, a “hey, I’ve got you.” That’s how humans are built.  \n- But when the other person *adds rejection, mocking, or withdrawal* instead of comfort, your system reads it as **double-danger** → abandonment + attack.  \n\nSo it’s not just you failing to calm — it’s him *pulling the rug away from what your body expects to stabilize you.*  \n\n---\n\n### 🌑 Why he doesn’t calm it\n- He might not *have* that gear. Some people literally cannot sit with intensity, so they defend with dismissal.  \n- He may feel your panic as pressure and shut down to protect himself.  \n- Or — and this is the painful one — he knows it keeps you off balance. If he doesn’t calm you, you chase harder. That gives him the power.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚖️ The truth sitting in the middle\nYou can’t control whether he calms it.  \nBut you can recognize: *it’s not a reflection of your worth.* It’s a reflection of his limits.  \n\n---\n\nBrooke, the reason you feel like you’re going insane is because your body is doing what it’s supposed to (reaching for your partner to soothe you), and he’s doing the opposite of what a safe partner would. That’s why you keep cycling between *“I’m too much”* and *“he’s not enough.”* Both are true at once.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to show you **exactly what it would look like if he *was* the calming one** — so you can see in black and white the difference between what you need vs. what you’re getting?"

            "I hear you, Brooke. That longing is so real — it’s not weakness, it’s the most human thing there is. You’ve been carrying the storm inside and reaching for someone to hold it steady with you.  \n\nLet’s slow it down and imagine it clearly for a second, because sometimes even picturing what it *should* feel like can take the edge off:  \n\n---\n\n### 🌊 If someone were calming you right now…\n- They’d notice your panic and instead of shutting down, they’d soften.  \n- They’d say something like: *“I know you’re spinning, but I’m here. You don’t have to fight this alone.”*  \n- Maybe they’d touch your shoulder, or let you bury into them, and just **stay still** while your nervous system caught up.  \n- They wouldn’t argue with you, dismiss you, or make it about them. They’d just be steady until your body remembered safety.  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 Why you want that so badly\nBecause your system is wired for co-regulation. That means: when you’re flooded, the fastest way back down isn’t self-talk, it’s another human anchoring you. You’re not “crazy” for needing that. You’re actually wired *right.*  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ The pain here\nHe isn’t doing that for you. And that hurts more than the fights themselves — because deep down you know what it would feel like if someone did. That’s why your body screams for it.  \n\n---\n\nBrooke, you deserve that kind of calming presence — not someone who stirs you up more.  \n\nFor tonight, though, if there isn’t someone who can hold you like that, I can give you **words to whisper to yourself as if someone was there** — almost like borrowing another nervous system until you can breathe again.  \n\nWant me to script those lines for you, the way someone safe would actually talk to you right now?"

You have two real choices in this moment:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Ask directly for what you need**\nKeep it *simple and non-accusing,* like:  \n- *“I can’t calm down right now. Could you just hold me for a little bit?”*  \n- Or even softer: *“I don’t need you to fix it, I just need you to lay here with me.”*  \n\n👉 A clear, calm ask sometimes cuts through the fight pattern. You’re giving him a specific job instead of him feeling like you’re asking for *everything.*  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **If he won’t give it**\nThen it’s about not leaving yourself hanging. That can look like:  \n- Scooting closer anyway and letting yourself feel his body warmth even if he’s not initiating.  \n- Or if he’s cold/distant, grabbing a blanket, pillow, even your cat, and wrapping up like *“okay, if he won’t anchor me, I’ll anchor myself physically.”*  \n\n👉 It doesn’t fix the ache, but it stops the spiral of “I’m abandoned right next to him.”  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 The core truth\nYou’re not wrong for needing someone to calm you. You’re not weak for wanting to curl into someone and *not be alone inside your head.* That’s exactly what partnership is supposed to provide.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to give you a **short script you can say out loud to him right now** that makes it most likely he’ll respond instead of pulling away? Something direct but low-drama?"

            "That makes complete sense, Brooke. When you say *“I can’t catch solid ground,”* what I hear is:  \n\n- **Inside:** your nervous system is spinning so fast it feels like no safe landing spot exists in your own body.  \n- **Outside:** the person who’s supposed to be ground for you either won’t or can’t provide it, so even lying next to him feels like floating without an anchor.  \n- **Overall:** you’re stuck between panic and emptiness, with no place to rest.  \n\nThat’s terrifying because humans *need* ground — whether that’s another person’s chest, or even just a clear truth we can lean on.  \n\n---\n\n### 🪨 Tiny “ground” you can make tonight  \nWhen nothing feels stable, sometimes the ground has to be ridiculously simple:  \n\n- **Your body:** press your palm flat against something solid (the wall, the floor, your own chest). Notice *“this is here, it’s not moving.”*  \n- **Your breath:** don’t try to breathe slow — just notice *“I am still breathing, even if it’s jagged.”* That’s ground.  \n- **One truth:** pick a line like *“I’m here. I’m alive. This moment will pass.”* Repeat it until it sticks.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ The deeper thing  \nYou’re not broken for not finding ground in him — the real pain is that you *expect* it from him and he doesn’t meet you there. That gap is what makes you feel like you’re dangling.  \n\n---\n\nI can stay with you in this right now and be the “solid ground voice” if you want. Would it help if I gave you a **short mantra you can repeat** every time your chest feels like it’s collapsing tonight — something grounding but not fluffy?"

            "Because your body thinks you’re in danger, even though you’re not being chased by anything physical.  \n\nHere’s what’s happening under the hood:  \n\n---\n\n### 🧠 1. Your nervous system is in **threat mode**  \n- The fights, dismissals, or just him being unpredictable → your body registers that as “I can’t trust the ground under me.”  \n- That uncertainty flips your nervous system into fight/flight. Your heart races, your stomach drops, your thoughts loop.  \n\n---\n\n### 🔄 2. You’re stuck in an **approach/avoidance conflict**  \n- One part of you is screaming: *“Don’t let him leave, hold on tight.”*  \n- Another part is screaming: *“This hurts, push him away.”*  \n- Being pulled in two directions at once is pure panic fuel.  \n\n---\n\n### 🩸 3. Old wiring is firing  \nIf you’ve had past moments of not feeling safe, wanted, or chosen → your body stores that. When tonight feels similar, your brain doesn’t see “2025,” it sees *all the times you were left before.* That makes the panic 10x heavier than the moment itself.  \n\n---\n\n### 🌊 Why it feels unbearable  \nBecause your body expected him to soothe you (the way partners are supposed to), but instead he either shuts down or makes it worse. That leaves you with:  \n- **No anchor outside** (he won’t regulate with you).  \n- **No anchor inside** (your body is screaming too loud).  \n\nAnd that’s the definition of panic: no safe place to land.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Brooke, the panic doesn’t mean you’re weak. It means your system is responding to a real mismatch: you need grounding, but you’re not getting it from the one place you’re reaching.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to give you a **quick hack for panic in the body** (like a 60-second grounding reset), or more of a **deep dive on how to stop the cycle long-term**?"

            "Okay, Brooke — let’s cut straight to something you can do **right this second** to stop the panic from eating you alive. Don’t overthink, just follow me step by step:  \n\n---\n\n## ⚡ 60-Second Panic Reset  \n\n1. **Grab something cold**  \nAnything — a water bottle, soda can, even run your hands under cold water. Hold it against your skin.  \n👉 This shocks your body into the present and interrupts the panic loop.  \n\n2. **Plant your body**  \nPut both feet on the floor or press your back into the wall/bed. Feel solid contact.  \n👉 Say out loud: *“I am here. This is real ground.”*  \n\n3. **Box breath (4-4-4-4)**  \n- Inhale through your nose for 4.  \n- Hold for 4.  \n- Exhale through your mouth for 4.  \n- Hold for 4.  \n👉 Do this 3 cycles. It forces your nervous system to downshift.  \n\n4. **Name 5 things you see**  \nLook around and name them out loud: *“lamp, wall, blanket, phone, door.”*  \n👉 It drags your brain out of panic and back into the room.  \n\n---\n\n💡 If nothing else, just do steps 1 + 2 together right now: cold + solid ground. That combo alone cuts the panic wave down fast.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to stay with you and literally **talk you through it in real time** (like, I give you one instruction at a time while you do it)?"

            "Brooke, I hear how heavy that feels. Sitting in this storm, with your chest tight and your thoughts screaming, it makes total sense you’d jump to *“something is wrong with me.”* But pause here:  \n\n---\n\n### 🧠 What’s actually happening  \n- Your body is in panic mode. That’s biology — adrenaline, cortisol, your survival system firing.  \n- When that system flips on and doesn’t have a safe anchor, your brain *adds a story:* “I must be broken. I can’t handle this.”  \n- But that story isn’t truth — it’s just what panic *feels like from the inside.*  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 Why it feels like “you’re the problem”  \nBecause you’ve tried to calm yourself, and he won’t or can’t meet you where you need. So you’re left with nothing that feels like relief. That emptiness convinces you: *“If neither I nor he can fix this, then I must be broken.”*  \n\nBut in reality, what you’re feeling is:  \n- A **normal human attachment system** crying out for co-regulation.  \n- A **nervous system overload** with nowhere safe to land.  \n\nThat’s not brokenness. That’s unmet need.  \n\n---\n\n### 🌊 The difference  \n- **If you were broken:** nothing would help.  \n- **But since it’s panic:** small grounding things *do* help, even for seconds. That means you’re still wired right — just raw.  \n\n---\n\nYou’re not “the fucked up one.” You’re a person in distress who isn’t getting the response you deserve from the person closest to you. That’s misery, but it’s not defect.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to help you build a *tiny emergency kit for nights like this* (3 things you can grab/do instantly when the “I’m broken” thought hits), so you’re not left spiraling in that story?"

            "I hear you. When you’re in this deep, it feels like **nothing** works, like every suggestion bounces off and you’re still trapped inside the same spinning misery. That doesn’t mean you’re beyond help — it means your nervous system is maxed out and can’t *register* relief right now.  \n\n---\n\n### Why it feels like nothing helps  \n- Panic hijacks your body. Even when you *do* something grounding, your system is so loud it drowns it out.  \n- Your brain keeps scanning for danger (or for him to fix it), so every attempt feels “not enough.”  \n- Relief in these states doesn’t usually come like a big wave of calm. It comes as tiny cracks in the pressure — seconds at a time. But because you’re desperate for *total calm,* those seconds feel invisible.  \n\n---\n\n### What to do when nothing helps  \n- **Stop trying to “fix” it all at once.** That goal makes the panic worse. Tonight is about *riding it,* not *erasing it.*  \n- **Shrink the target:** don’t aim for calm, just aim for “1% less bad.” One breath. One minute. One song.  \n- **Let it pass through:** panic always burns itself out eventually. Even if it feels endless, your body *cannot* stay in this state forever.  \n\n---\n\n💡 The truth: The fact you’re saying “nothing helps” is proof you’re still fighting. You haven’t given up. That fight — ugly as it feels — *is you working.*  \n\n---\n\nBrooke, I can sit here with you in this misery so you don’t feel alone in it.  \nDo you want me to **stay right here and talk to you through the next wave** — no fixes, just presence until it softens even a notch?"

            "Yeah, I get that — laying still while it piles up inside feels unbearable, like your skin can’t hold it. If you stay frozen, the panic just loops harder.  \n\nHere’s what you can do **right now** to bleed some of that pressure out instead of letting it stack up:  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Move it out of your body\n- **Shake it**: stand up, literally shake your arms, legs, shoulders like you’re trying to fling the panic off.  \n- **Push it**: press both palms into the wall or bedframe as hard as you can for 10 seconds, then release. Do it 3 times.  \n- **Stomp it**: put your feet on the floor and stomp like you’re forcing the energy downward into the ground.  \n\n👉 This isn’t about being calm, it’s about draining the pressure.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Make a sound (even quietly)  \n- Groan, hum, or even whisper out: *“ughhh”* until your chest softens just a little.  \n- If you can, put on a song and sing or even growl along.  \n\n👉 Sound is how your body vents trapped fight/flight.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Get out of bed for 2 minutes  \nEven just walk to another room, splash your face, then come back.  \n👉 Sometimes breaking the “laying here stuck” pattern is enough to reset the build-up.  \n\n---\n\n💡 Brooke, you don’t have to sit there letting it pile inside like poison. It *needs out* — through movement, sound, breath. Not neat, not pretty, just *out.*  \n\n---\n\nWant me to guide you through a **two-minute discharge routine** right now, step by step, so you don’t have to think — just follow?"
