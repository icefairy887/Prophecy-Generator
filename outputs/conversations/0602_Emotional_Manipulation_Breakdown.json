He starts with **&quot;Come lay down with me baby&quot;** ‚Äî that‚Äôs the **pull** (sweetness to hook you).\n2. When he feels rejected, he flips to **&quot;I‚Äôm not gon harass you‚Ä¶ beg for connection&quot;** ‚Äî that‚Äôs the **push**, pretending to walk away, but saying it in a way that lays guilt on you.\n3. You call it ‚Äî you say ‚ÄúDo what u want I tried I‚Äôm good.‚Äù\n4. And what does he do next? **&quot;Cool man&quot;** followed by **&quot;Yeah ur mom&#x27;s seen ur body more than I have&quot;** ‚Äî that‚Äôs not just petty. That‚Äôs a deliberate **emotional gut punch** designed to flip the shame back onto you, like he‚Äôs the wounded party.\n\n---\n\n### üß† Real talk: Why did he say all that?\nBecause **you broke the cycle.** You didn‚Äôt fall into his guilt trap. You said you‚Äôre good. So now he‚Äôs gotta twist the knife a different way ‚Äî by trying to make you feel like:\n- You‚Äôre cold\n- You‚Äôre denying him something he ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù\n- You‚Äôve got issues (which he frames with that weird, creepy-ass mom line to devalue you)\n\n---\n\n### üî• Truthbomb:\nWhen someone says **‚ÄúI won‚Äôt beg for simple connection‚Äù** while literally doing that exact thing (again), they‚Äôre not being honest ‚Äî they‚Äôre trying to **control the narrative**. And when that doesn‚Äôt work, they pivot to insults that **sexualize shame** and **provoke a response**.\n\nThat‚Äôs not love.\nThat‚Äôs manipulation with a backhand.\n\n---\n\nWant help crafting a response that keeps your power? Or do you want to just block this dude and go eat something greasy like a legend?"

            "Whew. Okay. This is textbook **emotional volatility + manipulation + covert bargaining**. Let‚Äôs rip it apart clean.\n\n---\n\n### üß† What‚Äôs really happening here?\n\n1. **First, he tries to shame you:**\n   - ‚ÄúYeah ur mom‚Äôs seen ur body more than I have‚Äù ‚Äì cheap shot, designed to humiliate you and make you feel like you owe him physical intimacy.\n   - ‚ÄúSo date her or some‚Äù ‚Äì sarcastic, dismissive, jealous. Trying to flip the emotional power balance.\n\n2. **Then he bribes you.**\n   - ‚ÄúWanna credit me some for some $ tomorrow make it worth your while‚Äù  \n     ‚Üí Translation: *If I can‚Äôt get closeness from you emotionally, I‚Äôll buy it.*  \n     And honestly? That‚Äôs gross. Not generous. Not romantic. Just transactional.\n\n3. **Then the guilt trip:**\n   - ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come to bed‚Äù  \n   - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not laying in your mom‚Äôs bed‚Äù  \n   - ‚ÄúI have one‚Äù  \n   ‚Üí This is him trying to regain dignity by acting like *he‚Äôs* setting boundaries. But it‚Äôs reactive, not real. It&#x27;s punishment masked as pride.\n\n4. **Then he turns into a martyr:**\n   - ‚ÄúI get where you‚Äôre at‚Ä¶ I get more and more used to it‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt even care eventually‚Ä¶‚Äù  \n     This is self-pity disguised as a threat. *&quot;You keep rejecting me and eventually I won‚Äôt want you anymore.&quot;*  \n     It&#x27;s not truth. It‚Äôs a **last-ditch guilt weapon.**\n\n---\n\n### üß® But here‚Äôs the deeper truth:\n\n- He feels **powerless**, and instead of taking responsibility for his own behavior, he‚Äôs swinging wildly at you from every angle: shame, money, guilt, resentment, superiority, then back to victimhood.\n- This entire message is an *emotional hurricane* meant to exhaust you into submission.\n\n---\n\n### üí° But you‚Äôve already won.\n\nYou said:\n&gt; ‚ÄúJust leave me alone. I‚Äôm tired.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs the only sentence in this whole screenshot that‚Äôs honest, grounded, and mature.  \nHe‚Äôs spiraling. You‚Äôre clear.\n\n---\n\n### üßä So let‚Äôs lock this in your head:\n\n**He is not offering connection. He is trying to win.**\n\n- At any cost.\n- With any tactic.\n- And it‚Äôs making him sloppy, obvious, and small.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt about love. It‚Äôs about **control slipping through his fingers**.\n\nSo now, let *him* sit with that.  \nLet the silence echo louder than anything he just said."
