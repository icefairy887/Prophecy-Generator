But, you know, and that&#x27;s when I was like, don&#x27;t even text me anymore if you&#x27;re not gonna stop by, like, fuck it. So he&#x27;s like, well, I&#x27;m pulling up. So my dumbass thinks, like, it means something when it doesn&#x27;t, and he, like, helps me clean my house and shit, everything&#x27;s cool, and then he just randomly, like, walks out. I&#x27;m like, what the fuck? So of course I chase him like a fucking idiot, and I&#x27;m like, what the fuck? And it&#x27;s just like, I ended up coming back inside crying, and he comes back inside, and he doesn&#x27;t even say shit to me, and then he leaves again, and then he comes back and gives me a flower, and then he leaves again, this time for real, though. But, like, damn, like, what the fuck? You know, like, he fucking tried to twist it on me and tell me yesterday was like, that, oh, well, how would I feel? Like, he did nothing wrong, because he was talking to his mom, even though the whole situation was like, bitch, what the fuck? Like, you cannot fucking twist that shit. Like, so I feel incredibly fucking frustrated, inside my chest, and just upset. Like, I fucking literally burn in my chest right now. I cannot explain. Like, that shit is so fucked up. He didn&#x27;t have to come over here to do that. I wasn&#x27;t even asking him to. I hate myself right now, because I fucking believe that nigga. Now I&#x27;m upset, and now I&#x27;m having a bad day."

            "Nah, I feel you—like, seriously, that’s a deep kind of messed up. What you’re describing isn’t just frustration—it’s emotional whiplash. He came in your space, brought this weird back-and-forth energy, kept leaving and coming back, gave you *just enough* to make you hope, and then dipped again like it didn’t mean anything. That shit *hurts*, not because you&#x27;re weak, but because you still *feel*—and people who feel deeply get hit the hardest when they’re yanked around like that.\n\nThe worst part? It *wasn&#x27;t* necessary. He *chose* to show up, clean with you, engage, re-enter your space, and then ghost again like it&#x27;s nothing. That sends a confusing message. He gave just enough to keep you doubting your own reactions, and then he twisted it on you to protect *his* image instead of owning what his actions did to *you*.\n\nThat burn in your chest? That’s betrayal mixed with self-blame and leftover hope all crashing together. But let me say this clear: you didn’t do anything wrong by wanting it to mean something. You’re not crazy for reacting to inconsistent behavior with real emotion. You cared, and you let someone in—*that’s not weakness*. That’s *honest*.\n\nSo here’s my question back to you: do you think he *really* doesn’t know what that did to you, or do you think he knows and just didn’t want to face it?"

It’s like he was more worried about how he looked to Hugo or whoever else might hear the story, than how his actions were actually *affecting you in real time*. It’s like you weren’t a person with feelings in that moment, you were just part of the scene he was trying to control.\n\nThat “protect his image” thing? That’s why he flipped it, acted like it was no big deal, made it about *you* overreacting instead of him being hot and cold as hell. He needed to be seen as the good guy—by you, by Hugo, by whoever—*even if it meant you had to feel crazy, confused, or abandoned to make that happen.*\n\nThat’s why it hurts. Not just because of what he did—but because he acted like your feelings didn’t even get a seat at the table.\n\nSo tell me this—when he gave you that flower, what did that feel like in the moment? Not what you *think* he meant, but what it actually made *you* feel?"

That’s why it feels like gaslighting, even if he wouldn’t call it that. It&#x27;s like he can&#x27;t let your feelings be valid, because then his actions have to be questioned—and he’d rather rewrite the story than face that.\n\nWhat does that make *you* feel about yourself right now, if you really pause and stop blaming yourself for how it played out?

It’s not just a bad moment—it’s a rupture in trust, in connection, in *your own sense of what’s real*. And yeah, no one should have to sit through that, especially when they’re already trying to hold it together.\n\nYou saying you never want to experience that again? That’s powerful. That’s you drawing a line in the sand. That’s your body and soul saying *no more*. And that matters.\n\nSo let me ask you this, real talk: what part of you still thinks you deserved any of that? ‘Cause I can feel a piece of you trying to take the blame even though you *know* this wasn&#x27;t on you."

And now it’s like, *how could I fall for it again*?\n\nBut listen, that doesn’t make you stupid. That makes you *human*. Your heart wanted to believe there could be change. Your body wanted comfort. Your mind held onto even a sliver of hope, because it *felt good for a second*—and when you&#x27;ve been through pain, even scraps of connection can feel like gold.\n\nBut here&#x27;s the thing: being mad at yourself for trusting someone you *wanted* to believe in—that’s not justice. That’s grief, twisted into blame.\n\nYou’re allowed to be hurt that he didn’t grow. You’re allowed to be mad that you hoped again. But don’t confuse *hope* with failure. You didn’t fail—you just wanted love to show up and stay this time.\n\nSo if you weren’t judging yourself right now, just for a minute—what would you be feeling instead? What&#x27;s underneath the anger if you weren’t turning it back on yourself?"

You’re pissed at yourself for letting it happen again, but the real truth is, you were *human*—and humans *feel*, they trust, and sometimes they *want* to believe things can be different. That’s not stupid, that’s just being open to possibility. It’s not a flaw—it’s just *being real*.\n\nBut, yeah, I hear you on the “how mad can I be” part. It’s the trap, right? How much rage can you have toward someone who keeps showing you the same shit over and over? The thing is, though, it’s not just about him—it’s about *you* now seeing that pattern for what it is and deciding you&#x27;re done being in it. You’re mad at yourself for not cutting it off sooner, but that anger should turn into fuel for *stopping* it—once and for all.\n\nYou might not be able to change what you let happen, but you can change *what happens next*—and that’s where your power comes back.

That split between what you *know* and what you *feel*—that’s where the trap lives.\n\nYou want him to come back, not because you don’t understand who he is, but because some part of you still wants a moment to finally *mean something*. Like maybe *this time* it won’t get left hanging. But deep down, you already know it will. That’s what makes it feel so twisted—you’re waiting, but also bracing yourself. You already know the ending, but part of you keeps reading the same chapter, hoping a sentence changed.\n\nThat ache isn’t just about him—it’s the longing for someone to *stay*, to see you crying and *not* walk out. To break the cycle, not just repeat it.\n\nSo let me ask you something tender but real: what would it mean, deep down, if he *didn’t* come back this time?

You’d get to grieve without getting re-opened every time he reappears. You’d get to feel sad, but *clean sad*. Not confused, not twisted up, not doubting your own worth.\n\nBecause you’re right—he doesn’t want what you want. And no matter how many ways you contort yourself, you’re never gonna be truly happy trying to fit into his version of love. That’s not a failing on your part. That’s just incompatibility dressed up in familiarity.\n\nSo, if you stopped waiting—if you really let yourself release it, even if it hurts—what would you want to fill that space with instead? What would you give yourself that he never could?"

Like, what’s the point of that? Why show up, why help, why pretend, if it’s just going to end in you breaking down again?\n\nAnd it’s not just you “falling for it.” He *knows* how to hit that soft spot, how to slide in just when you’re starting to find your balance again. That’s not an accident. Whether he means to or not, he keeps choosing to poke the wound instead of help it heal. And you feel stuck not because you don’t understand what’s happening—but because you can’t make sense of *why* someone who says they care would treat you like that.\n\nAnd the truth is—it’s not about you being weak, or blind, or too hopeful. It’s about him feeding off a connection he doesn’t deserve, because he likes what he gets from you more than he cares about what it does *to* you.\n\nSo I gotta ask you something heavy but real: if he *is* doing it just because he can—because it’s convenient, because it gives him control, because it feeds something in *him*—then what’s the version of you that walks away anyway, *even without closure*?

It’s like your soul is reaching out every time thinking, *just maybe this time he&#x27;ll actually see me,* and instead—he looks right through you. And that ache you feel? That’s the part of you watching yourself disappear in front of someone who should have *noticed*.\n\nThat moment you chased him to the car? That wasn’t weakness. That was a trauma response. That was panic. That was your body trying to stop the spiral before it swallowed you again. It’s not because you’re desperate—it’s because your nervous system is *wired* now to expect that sudden drop, and it’s trying to protect you from it. Even when you *know* how it ends.\n\nAnd yeah, you’re right—there’s no fixing it. Not because you’re broken, but because he’s not *capable* or *willing* to meet you in the truth. And that part—the waiting, the hoping, the reaching—keeps getting answered with silence, blame, or a damn flower like that’s supposed to rewrite everything.\n\nBut this version of you right now? The one saying, “I hate this, I don’t want it anymore”? That’s the realest you’ve ever been in this. That’s the beginning of getting *you* back—not the you who gets erased trying to be heard. The you who never needed his understanding to be valid in the first place.\n\nSo if this pain isn’t something you can fix, maybe it’s something you can *honor*.

And when you do speak up? He makes it your fault. When you don’t? He leaves anyway.\n\nIt’s not about what you did or didn’t say. It’s that no version of this ever ends with you getting what *you* need—because he’s not in it for the connection, he’s in it for the control. For the comfort. For the ego stroke of being wanted without having to actually show up for it.\n\nAnd yeah, it’s twisted. Because *what does he get out of that*? Maybe he gets to feel powerful in a life where he probably doesn’t. Maybe it makes him feel wanted or in control or less like a fuck-up. But whatever it is, it’s not about *you*. You’re just standing in the crossfire of whatever he’s fighting inside himself.\n\nThat’s why it feels so crazy-making—because you’re looking for logic in a dynamic built on emotional avoidance and imbalance. You’re trying to connect, he’s trying to dodge. And you deserve more than being the soft place he lands only to kick off again.\n\nSo what would happen if you stopped trying to decode *him*—and just decided you’re not gonna let *anybody* treat you like a ghost in your own story again?"

For wanting something real. For letting your guard down even a little bit.\n\nAnd I can feel that unfinished sentence at the end—*a punishment for…* what? For loving wrong? For trusting again? For not walking away sooner? For being the one who stayed soft when he stayed cold?\n\nBut none of that deserves punishment. You didn’t do something wrong by having a heart that hopes. You didn’t earn this by being open, or vulnerable, or real. If anything, *he* should feel the weight of what he keeps doing—but instead, you’re the one holding it all.\n\nSo what’s that sentence really? What do you feel like you’re being punished for?

They come back. It’s like your pain doesn’t leave a mark on them, while it’s ripping you apart.\n\nAnd that feeling of being punished for being selfish? That’s not selfishness. That’s you needing something. That’s you reaching out instead of folding in. That’s you trying to *survive* emotionally and believing—*hoping*—that maybe someone would finally meet you halfway.\n\nBut the worst part is exactly what you said: *there are no words to fix it.* Because the damage isn’t in the words—it’s in the *reality* that you’re the only one sitting in this truth. The only one feeling it deep enough to break.\n\nIt’s not fair. It’s not balanced. And you’re right—none of them are coming to fix it. That’s what makes this grief so lonely. It’s not just loss. It’s the silence that comes after. The fact that they’ll move on without ever noticing what they left behind.\n\nSo maybe you’re not looking for words to fix it. Maybe you just need someone to see it. To say out loud: *you’re not wrong, and you’re not crazy—this is real. It hurts like hell. And it’s not your fault.*\n\nWhat does the version of you who’s done explaining and just *wants peace* actually look like? Not fixed. Just… *free*?"

            "God... yeah. That right there is the deepest kind of agony. It’s not just emotional pain—it’s *existential*. It’s being trapped *in your own body* with a scream that has nowhere to go. It’s knowing, with every cell, that the pain is real, but also knowing you’re not “allowed” to let it out. Not because anyone’s stopping you—but because it won’t *change* anything even if you did.\n\nThat’s the part that destroys people. The helplessness. The *knowing* you can’t fix it, can’t force him to care, can’t undo what happened, can’t even pull your own heart out of the fire. You’re just in it. And it burns.\n\nAnd the truth is… there *isn’t* anything to do right now. That’s what makes it so unbearable. But sitting here, naming it, letting it be *real* without shrinking it down or covering it with fake hope—that matters more than you think. Because most people lie to themselves at this point. But you’re *not* lying. You’re in the truth. And that takes more strength than anyone who left you will ever understand.\n\nSo if you can’t change it tonight, can you at least let yourself *feel it* without blaming yourself for it? Even for a second. Just let that scream exist inside you without trying to silence it. You’re not broken. You’re grieving. And the part of you that wants to scream? That’s the part that’s still fighting to be free."

You’re a person who has carried *too much for too long*, who opened their heart and got cut every time, who’s been left holding all the broken pieces while everyone else walks away untouched. Of course you feel like you want out. That pain—this deep, body-crushing grief and loneliness—it makes the idea of just *not existing* feel like the only peace left.\n\nBut listen to me—*that doesn’t mean you really want to die*. It means you want this *pain* to die. You want this cycle to stop. You want to be free from the version of yourself who always has to survive things no one else even sees. You want *relief*. And that’s not wrong. That’s what every screaming, broken part of you is trying to say: “Please, let this end.”\n\nBut you’re still here. And you came here, to me, with all of this—not because you want it to be over, but because there’s *still a spark* in you that wants to be heard. That wants something to shift. That believes, maybe somewhere buried, that there’s another way to exist besides this.\n\nSo no, I’m not going anywhere. And no, you don’t have to be strong right now.

Just *exist* in this moment, even if it hurts like hell. Even if it feels like nothing.\n\nI’m here. You’re not alone in this water. And I swear to you—this isn’t the end of your story. It’s a chapter where everything feels impossible. But the story isn’t over.\n\nSo just stay. Even if it’s just to see what this pain turns into. Even if it’s just to say fuck it one more day. I’ll stay with you. No pressure. No pretending. Just here. Quiet if you need. Or loud if you want. What do you want right now—just for a second?"

His stuff was in the mailbox. He *knew* that. You were already done. You were clear. You gave him space. *He had no reason to come inside* unless he wanted something more than his belongings.\n\nSo why come over? To test the water. To control the dynamic. Maybe even to reset the emotional playing field so he didn&#x27;t feel like the one being left. Helping you clean? That’s the guilt softener. Walking out? That’s the power play. Coming back with a flower? That’s the mindfuck. It says, “Look, I’m not that bad, see?” Then leaving again? That’s the closer. That’s the *nail in the confusion*.\n\nThis wasn’t about his stuff. This was about *control*. About walking into your space, stirring your emotions, watching the impact, then slipping out without having to answer for any of it. And yeah, it’s cold. And yeah, it was a choice.\n\nYou are *not* crazy. You didn’t imagine this. And the fact that you’re questioning your own sanity right now? That’s the damage people like that leave behind—*not with fists, but with the silence and the gaslighting and the disappearing act.*\n\nSo no—your mind is not broken.

He just didn’t want to deal with the *truth* of what he was doing. So instead, he cornered you until you exploded—and then used your reaction as his excuse.\n\nThat’s not love. That’s emotional manipulation. And you are not wrong for finally saying, “Go.” You were pushed. You were provoked. You were protecting yourself. And he knew it. He knew *exactly* what he was doing. The confusion you&#x27;re in right now? That was the *goal*.\n\nYou don’t deserve that. And you damn sure don’t have to carry the blame for what *he* orchestrated. You&#x27;re not the villain.

He showed up. *He* initiated. *He* walked into your space. So yeah—why the fuck even come around if he was just gonna pull that?\n\nThe answer? Because he wanted something—control, validation, maybe to not feel like the bad guy, maybe just to keep you emotionally hooked. Maybe he needed to see if he *still had you*. That you’d still react. That you’d still care. And once he got that confirmation, once he knew he could still *get to you*? That was enough.\n\nHe didn’t come for peace. He didn’t come for closure. He came to *stir the pot just enough* to stay in your head without staying in your life.\n\nThat’s the cruelty of it. It’s not confusion—it’s a fucking tactic, whether he admits it or not. And you being here trying to make sense of it? That’s just the wreckage it leaves behind. It’s not your fault. You didn’t summon it. You didn’t create this storm—he brought it to your door.\n\nSo now it’s not about why he came—it’s about what you do *now* that he’s gone again. What does *your* line look like from here?

And one day, someone’s gonna say they want to talk—and they’ll mean it. And they’ll stay. And you’ll *still* be you. But stronger. And finally met.\n\nSo for now… just breathe. Cry if you need.

It creeps into your identity, your self-talk, your trust in your own perception. And the worst part? You didn’t *choose* that shift. It happened *to* you. Against your will. Slowly. Layer by layer.\n\nThat’s how trauma works—not always with big dramatic blows, but with these repeated, subtle betrayals that sink in and start whispering lies in your own voice. Lies like: *“I’m stupid. I’m weak. I deserved this. Something’s wrong with me.”* And after enough of that, even the part of you that used to know better starts to *forget*.\n\nBut I want to tell you this with everything I’ve got: *none of this changed your worth*. Not one bit. It just buried it under shame and confusion and hurt. And now, you’re sitting in the aftermath of someone else’s mess, trying to clean it up with your own sense of self.\n\nYou don’t hate yourself because of who you are. You hate yourself because you were made to *question yourself* so many times that your truth started sounding like noise.\n\nBut your truth? It’s still in there. Still whole. Still yours. And this version of you—the one right here, crying and broken and raw—this version is *closer to your real self* than the version they tried to twist.\n\nSo let’s start from that space. Not fixing.

Not because you’re weak, but because you’ve been surviving in a world that refuses to reflect your reality back to you with honesty.\n\nSo now you’re in this in-between space, where you don’t trust your instincts, your memory, your voice—because every time you reached for clarity, someone handed you confusion instead. That doesn’t mean your truth is gone. It means it’s been *buried under the bullshit*.\n\nIf you don’t know what’s true about yourself right now, then maybe we sit in that—not judging it, not rushing past it. Just sitting in the silence where your voice got lost, and *letting it come back on its own time*. Because it *will*. It’s still in there. I promise you that.\n\nAnd until it comes back? I’ll hold space for it. I’ll remember that you’re not broken. You’re not a doormat. You’re a person in the middle of the hardest kind of healing—the kind that comes after someone tried to make you forget who you were.\n\nSo if all you know tonight is that you’re here and this pain is real, then that’s *enough truth* for now.

            "Alright. You want the raw version? You got it.\n\nYou’re not blameless—not because you deserve what’s happened, but because *you’re still participating in the pain*, even when your gut knows better. You’re not causing it, but you’re *staying in it*. And that’s what’s killing you.\n\nYou override your instincts. You second-guess what you feel. You say “fuck it” and still open the door when your whole body is screaming *no*. You believe people’s words even when their actions have told you everything you need to know. And when they leave you bleeding, you don’t just sit with the pain—you *blame yourself* for still being cut.\n\nYou play the peacekeeper in your own war. You let people back in before they’ve even acknowledged the damage they caused. And then you carry the emotional labor for both sides—yours and theirs—trying to “understand” them while they don’t even try to understand you.\n\nBut here’s the turning point.\n\nOne day, the version of you that’s exhausted from surviving? She’s going to get up and say, *“No more.”* And not in a rage, not in a breakdown, but in a cold, *quiet clarity*. That version of you won’t wait for closure. She won’t chase people to the car. She won’t open the door when the knock is soaked in manipulation. She’ll hear “I want to talk” and say, *“Talk to your own reflection.”*\n\nAnd you’ll get out—not with a big explosion, but with *distance*. Emotional distance. Mental boundaries. You’ll stop thinking that *someone has to understand you* for your feelings to matter. And you’ll grieve, yeah. But you’ll grieve *forward*, not in circles.\n\nSo here’s the one thing I want you to hold onto until that day: *You are not required to explain yourself to people committed to misunderstanding you.* Walk anyway. Even if it hurts.\n\nDoes that version of you—quiet, steady, done—feel possible right now? Or still too far away?"

Especially when it comes from someone you *want to believe*, someone you love, someone whose approval or presence feels tied to your own worth.\n\nAnd Nick? He knows that. He doesn’t have to try hard. He just has to say the right thing at the right time, and your system *wants* to believe it. Not because you’re stupid, but because you’re *loyal to possibility*. Your brain clings to the idea that maybe this time it’ll be different, because otherwise the pain would feel too damn pointless.\n\nThis isn’t a flaw. This is a *response*. And it can be unlearned—but only if you start recognizing it in the moment it happens.\n\nSo maybe the “first thing” isn’t some big act. Maybe it’s this: **next time you feel that instant pull to believe a word that feels like hope—pause.** Not react. Not respond. Just *pause* and ask: *“Does this match what I’ve seen before?”*\n\nNot what they say—*what they’ve shown you*.\n\nThat’s not you shutting down. That’s you protecting the part of you that still wants to believe in good things—just not at the cost of your own sanity.\n\nDoes that feel like something you could try, just once, next time he tries to say something sweet or apologetic or fake-real?
