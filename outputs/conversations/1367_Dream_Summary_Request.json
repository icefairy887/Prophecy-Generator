I don&#x27;t know why I got out. And then, in another part of the dream, I went back to this same place, like, and it&#x27;s like this, these big hills, foresty, kind of like around this pond, this big-ass pond, and like, you know, for whatever reason, I don&#x27;t remember who exactly I was with, maybe another version of myself, or maybe my cousin, something, and I think Nick was in there somewhere. But so we go around to, like, the other side of this pond, and we were trying to walk around it, but, like, it wasn&#x27;t, I was thinking it wasn&#x27;t a good idea, because part of the pond was, like, it was hard to go through. It was a thing about water throughout my whole dream. And, like, we&#x27;re over on the other side of this pond, and it&#x27;s kind of a hill with, like, pine straw and dirt and, like, big trees, right? And it&#x27;s elevated from the water, and there are these holes all right there where someone had been digging, and I don&#x27;t remember what the fuck we were looking for, but there were snakes there, and then there was this cat that came out or something like that, like a mancoon cat, which is okay. I was watching cats about video, I mean videos about cats before I went to sleep, so that makes sense. But then, you know, we were walking, and we had these guns, like a BB gun and a gun or something like that, and whoever I was with, they were walking in front, and I had my back to them, you know, watching them behind, and we were walking, and this, like, orange dog, kind of, like, almost like a coyote dog, but not really, like a dingo dog type thing, showed up and was following us, but I don&#x27;t think it was mean, but it was orange."

            "Yeah. That’s a lot. But dreams like this, they’re never random. They’re stitched together by instinct, not logic.\n\nLet’s tear it down.\n\nYou left the car. Thought it’d be safe. It wasn’t. That’s trust—misplaced. In yourself, in the ground beneath you, in the idea that you can walk away from something and it’ll still be there when you come back.\n\nThe forested pond? That’s deeper terrain. Memory wrapped in terrain you don’t fully know. Companion shifting shapes—your cousin, yourself, maybe both. That’s identity warping under pressure. Who&#x27;s got your back? Who *are* you when things get rough?\n\nThe digging, the snakes, the cat. Someone’s been searching there. Maybe you. Maybe long ago. The holes say effort. The snakes say danger. And the cat? That’s the only sign of life that doesn’t hiss or strike. Instinct, maybe. Soft in the middle of all that risk.\n\nThen the guns. You’re armed, but with BBs and half-measures. Like you’re prepared—but not for a real fight. And the orange dog trailing you? Sounds like a shadow. Not hostile, but wild. Unclaimed. Uncontrolled. Could be danger, could be warning.\n\nAll of it loops around water. Movement. Uncertainty. A boundary you keep trying to cross, but every way around it feels wrong.\n\nYou tell me, kid—what in your life feels like that pond right now? Big. Surrounded. Hard to move through."

You&#x27;re running from water that creeps, rises, overwhelms. You park on the edge of danger and act like it’ll stay put. Then you leave, and hell rolls in.\n\nThat road level with the water? That’s no mistake. That’s the line you keep walking in your life. Too close. Too exposed. Acting like it’s stable when it’s barely holding.\n\nAnd the flood warning—sure, it came from your phone. But it only stuck because something *in you* already knew it was true. You dream about warnings because you’re ignoring real ones. Or maybe you&#x27;re numb to them.\n\nWhite truck washed away? That’s not just a vehicle. It’s someone else’s future, someone else&#x27;s plan, something clean and hopeful—gone. Just like that. And you see it. You hate it. But you’re not sure what to do besides walk.\n\nSo here’s the brutal truth: these dreams aren’t just fear. They’re training. Your mind&#x27;s running scenarios because some part of you knows—you keep playing it too close to the edge. And one day, the wave won&#x27;t just wash *behind* you.\n\nYou still think it’s just a dream, rookie? Or are you starting to feel what it’s trying to say?"

You park on it, thinking you’re safe. You&#x27;re not. You’re hesitating. Living on the edge of a decision and calling that stability.\n\n**The car** — your control. Your independence. Every time you leave it, it gets threatened. Washed away or nearly. That’s your power slipping because you didn’t lock it down.\n\n**The white truck** — maybe someone else&#x27;s plan. Maybe some clean version of you. Gone in the current. You watch it vanish.\n\n**The flood warnings** — you’ve been warned. In life, not just dreams. And you&#x27;re not listening. Maybe you’re tired. Maybe you’re stubborn. Doesn’t matter. The warnings don’t stop the water.\n\n**The repetition** — that’s your brain screaming. You&#x27;ve seen this before. You didn’t listen. So now it’s back.

Watching your back, BB gun or not. And that orange dog—wasn’t attacking. Wasn’t barking. Just following.\n\nHere’s what I see: that dog’s the part of you that’s wild, untamed, and watching. Not a threat—yet. But not fully yours either. You don’t trust it. Not completely. You don’t know what it wants. But it’s tracking you anyway.\n\nOrange? That’s fire. Change. Risk. Could be instinct, courage, some part of your psyche waiting for you to claim it. Or it could be a warning. Something old that’s been following you, waiting for the moment you drop your guard.\n\nBut it didn’t bite. Didn’t growl. Just walked with you.\n\nSo maybe it’s this: the part of you that’s been through the flood, through the hill, through the snakes—and came out *feral but loyal*. It doesn&#x27;t need to be leashed. It just needs to be *recognized*.\n\nNext time you dream it, look it in the eyes. See if it follows you *by choice.* That’ll tell you everything."

And, um, anyway, the orange dog reminded me of the dog that my grandparents had. He barks at me constantly, won&#x27;t talk to me, nothing, does not like me. Only dog that&#x27;s ever really done that."

            "There it is. The dogs aren’t random. They’re messengers. And they’re speaking loud, even if they don’t bark.\n\nThat black shepherd? Not just a bite—it was a judgment. You stepped out with Nick, and something in you didn’t trust it. Or didn’t trust *him*. The dog knew. Bit your hand like it was saying, *“Don’t follow. Don’t touch. Not with him behind you.”* Roaches inside, rot at the core. Something was off, and the dream called it.\n\nNow that orange dog—same breed line, maybe, same setting—but different tone. No bite. Just eyes. Quiet. It reminds you of a real dog that hates you for no clear reason. That’s not meaningless. That dog represents rejection. An intuition that says, *“You don’t belong here. This place sees you as foreign.”*\n\nBut in the dream? It follows you. Makes eye contact. It’s not rejecting you—it’s watching to see if you’ve earned it. If you’ve *changed.*\n\nThis isn’t about dogs. It’s about *trust.* First you trusted Nick. Got bit. Now you trust yourself—or you&#x27;re trying to. And that orange dog is waiting to see if it should believe you.\n\nSo ask yourself: what are you trying to lead now, that you once let slip? And do you even believe in your own path, or are you still looking over your shoulder?"
