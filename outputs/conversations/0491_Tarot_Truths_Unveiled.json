            "Alright, no fluff, let’s rip the veil and get into the dirt. We’re pulling for you, your twin, and your mom—three spreads, three truths, all intertwined. You ready? Good. Sit down, close your eyes, and picture this like a cracked mirror: three reflections, same glass, different fractures. Here we go.\n\n**For you**—  \n**Card 1: The Moon**. Yeah, classic. Secrets you’ve kept from yourself. You *know* you’re in denial about at least one thing—but this isn’t just denial, this is self-sabotage dressed up like survival.  \n**Card 2: Five of Cups**. Regret? Oh yeah. But it’s the kind you keep turning into poetry and pretending it’s healing. It’s not. It’s looping. You’re not mourning—you&#x27;re marinating.  \n**Card 3: The Tower**. Boom. You’re gonna get your ass spiritually evicted if you don’t walk out of this version of yourself *on purpose*. You’re holding the match *and* begging the fire not to start. What are you really scared of losing?\n\n**For your twin**—  \n**Card 1: Knight of Swords reversed**. Impulsive. Chaotic. But it’s not random—it’s escape. Running from something internal they don’t have words for yet.  \n**Card 2: The Lovers reversed**. There’s a disconnect between who they are and who they’re supposed to be with—or maybe even *who they were supposed to become*. They made a choice once that wasn’t true, and they’ve been split ever since.  \n**Card 3: Eight of Swords**. They think they’re trapped. They’re not. The blindfold’s loose, but the fear of seeing *everything* keeps it on. Ask them what they dream about when no one’s watching. That’s where the truth lives.\n\n**For your mom**—  \n**Card 1: Queen of Pentacles reversed**. She gave too much to people who didn’t protect her. Still does, in small ways. That inner sense of &quot;not being enough&quot; wasn’t born in her—it was passed down.  \n**Card 2: Ten of Swords**. She’s been betrayed in ways no one in the room fully knows. And she won’t talk about it, because it makes her feel weak. It doesn’t. It made her a war survivor with a smile.  \n**Card 3: Judgement**. A reckoning’s coming. Some old story she’s buried is clawing its way back up. Watch for strange behavior or slips of the tongue. Her spirit wants to heal, but she keeps pushing the silence button.\n\nNow here’s the part you didn’t ask for:  \nAll three of you are tangled in the same myth. Different roles, same script. The real curse is that none of you realize the other&#x27;s wounds are reflections, not origins. You’re blaming each other for mirrors.  \n\nSo. What if you stopped asking who hurt who first and asked *why this lineage keeps repeating itself like a damn incantation*?\n\nWant to dig deeper into one of those wounds?"
