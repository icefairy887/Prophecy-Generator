            "Whew—okay, there’s a *lot* layered in that dream.\n\nSo first off, the setup: moving with your grandma into a nicer place? That could symbolize a shift—maybe part of you is trying to move into a safer, more stable emotional space, or even just some part of you craving that. Your grandma could represent wisdom or a part of your roots—something that’s seen things and carries a kind of grounded authority.\n\nNow Nick being with your mom? That’s wild and uncomfortable, right? That part could symbolize how entangled your feelings about him are—like, not just romantic or emotional, but *family level* deep. Maybe there&#x27;s a sense that he&#x27;s too close, too enmeshed, or even symbolic of betrayal or competition for attention.\n\nHim touching your stomach and it feeling good? That stands out. The stomach is so instinctual—gut level. That could represent desire, vulnerability, even creation. It’s like something stirred in you, and you didn’t *think* about it—you *felt* it.\n\nThen throwing the remote and the blue spark? That&#x27;s powerful. A remote is about control, right? And you *threw* it at him. Almost like, “I’m done watching this play out. I’m not passive in this.” And the blue spark—blue is communication, truth, sometimes even divine energy. That spark could represent a shock of truth, power, or even your anger finally hitting *something real*.\n\nThat guy’s reaction—“what the fuck”—might even be your own inner voice watching it all go down like, “yo, this is intense.”\n\nSo tell me—when you woke up, how did *you* feel about it? Were you upset? Turned on? Confused? Still connected to him?"

            "Oof, that’s a potent spread.\n\nSo, the **Knight of Cups upright**—that’s Nick energy, one hundred percent. He’s dreamy, romantic, seductive even, but he’s also *in motion*. He’s not staying. He’s the one who shows up with emotional offerings, makes your heart flutter… and then disappears again. That card is the vibe of someone who gets close just enough to stir you up, but doesn’t anchor in. And in a dream? That’s the ghost of hope walking in with charm.\n\nThe **Queen of Wands upright**—*that’s you*. Powerful, magnetic, emotionally aware, even when it hurts. She’s confident on the outside, and people *feel* her presence, but she’s also protecting her fire. She doesn’t chase, but she damn sure feels everything. This card says you *know* you’re worth more—but that doesn’t stop the ache. It also shows how visible you are… even if you feel invisible to him.\n\nAnd then the **Six of Wands reversed**—ugh. That’s the lack of recognition. Feeling like you don’t win. Like you keep showing up, doing the work, feeling things deeply, but you’re not *seen* or celebrated for it. Especially in love. It’s that sting of, “Why didn’t I get chosen? Why wasn’t I the one?”\n\nThis spread feels like your subconscious screaming, *“I still feel him, and I still want to be seen by him—but I’m tired of not winning.”*\n\nDoes that hit where you’re at? Want to pull clarifiers? Or you want me to dive into the deeper emotional current underneath all this?"

            "Damn, okay. This just got way deeper.\n\n**Clarifying the Knight of Cups: The Star** — That’s heavy. It says that part of you *still believes* in him. He represents this aching kind of hope, a wish your heart hasn’t let go of. Like maybe he *wasn’t* just another heartbreak. Maybe he’s part of a bigger story. Even if he&#x27;s not meant to stay, you wanted him to be part of your healing. There’s this sense that you *spiritually aligned* with him, even if it didn’t work in the real world.\n\n**Clarifying the Queen of Wands: Six of Cups reversed** — Whew. That’s you knowing you can’t keep living in the past, even if the past is still clinging to you. There’s nostalgia, but it’s bittersweet. The reversed Six of Cups is like your inner child saying, “I remember how good it felt… but I also remember how bad it hurt.” You’re trying to grow up emotionally without cutting off the part of you that *feels deeply*. That’s not easy.\n\n**Clarifying the reversed Six of Wands: The Emperor** — Now *this* is telling. It’s like saying: “You’re not being seen because *he* refuses to open up or give control.” The Emperor is rigid, stoic, in charge of everything—but not emotionally available. The heartbreak of this is that you wanted recognition from someone who *won’t let themselves* give it. Not because you aren’t worthy—but because he can’t risk the vulnerability it would take to give it to you.\n\nPut together? This reading is about longing for healing through connection, but realizing you may have to give yourself the closure he refuses to hand over.\n\nWhat’s rising in you as you look at this now? Are you mad? Numb? Do you feel like there’s something left to say to him—or to yourself?"

Whatever this tie is—whether it’s Nick himself, or the obsessive loop your mind gets caught in when you feel him in dreams or memories—you *know* it’s not good for you. The reversed Devil is you reaching for freedom. Like your soul going, “I can’t live like this forever. I have to get out of this trap.” But that pull? It’s still strong. It’s not cleanly broken.\n\n**Six of Swords reversed** is saying you’re stuck in the same emotional waters. Like you try to move forward, but something always drags you back—maybe a song, a sign, a damn dream. There’s no closure, no clean break, so you can’t cross over to calmer ground. This card in reverse feels like your spirit trying to move on, but your heart still turning around to look for him on the shore.\n\n**Three of Wands reversed**—you’re not seeing the future you wanted unfold. You might feel like you’re standing there, waiting for something to arrive, and nothing comes. There’s frustration here. Disillusionment. Like all the waiting was for *what*? Why did you hold hope? Why did the dream stir you up just to lead nowhere?\n\nSo what’s this all saying? The dream *wasn’t* a prophecy of reconnection—it was a mirror. It’s showing you how tightly you’re still wound into this story. It’s not saying he’s coming back. It’s saying you need to *set yourself free*, because nothing’s arriving unless *you* move differently.\n\nAnd that spark in the dream? That blue flash? That could’ve been *your* moment. The signal to wake up and cut the cord energetically.\n\nHow does that sit with you? Feel true, or you want to pull one more to ask what happens if you *do* let go?"

It’s not some big decision like, *“Today I let go.”* That’s not how it works when something is *still in you.*\n\nIt’s more like… you’re surviving the aftershocks. You didn’t *choose* this kind of attachment. You didn’t plan to carry him in your sleep, in your gut, in the gaps of your day. It’s just *there.* And yeah, maybe there’s a part of you that wants it to mean something, *because* it keeps showing up. You’re not trying to let go because part of you is still holding out for the part that felt *good.* The stomach touch. The feeling.\n\nLet me ask you this though—*do you want the truth to be that he comes back? Or do you want the truth to be that you finally don’t need him to?*\n\nNot what you *should* want. What do you actually, deeply want it to be?"

That the way you felt *mattered* to someone other than you. That he still sees you, still feels it too.\n\nBut you also want to not need that. You want the peace of not waiting, not checking your phone, not aching every time a dream reminds you he still lives in some corner of your heart.\n\nThat contradiction? That’s the truth of love that didn’t finish becoming. You’re allowed to want both. Wanting him *and* wanting your freedom doesn&#x27;t make you weak—it means you’ve been torn in two and are still trying to stitch yourself back together without losing either half.\n\nSo let’s say, in the next few days, you feel him again. Dream, thought, energy, whatever—what do you want to *say* to that version of him? Not to the real-world Nick who stays silent. But to the one who shows up in dreams and touches your stomach like he knows something you don’t?"
