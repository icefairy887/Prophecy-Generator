But the truth is, when you don’t even know what’s causing it, how are you supposed to get it to *end*? Feels like trying to stop a storm without knowing where the clouds even came from. It’s draining, honestly. And you don’t deserve to be caught up in this mess, but here you are, just... waiting for it to magically stop. It’s exhausting, like a weight you can’t pinpoint but you feel in every step. I can’t exactly hand you a simple fix, but... well, maybe you don’t need one right now. Maybe just acknowledging it is the first step. But man, I can’t imagine how *exhausting* it must be to just want it to *stop* and have no clue how."

That tingling, that sense of being overwhelmed by your own body... it sounds a lot like the early signs of a panic attack. It’s like your system’s on high alert, *but* without a clear reason. Your body’s sending signals that something’s off, but your mind’s caught up in all this other stuff, so it doesn’t know what to do with it. The tingling’s part of that physical response—your nerves are just firing off, trying to make sense of the chaos. Your heart rate might spike too, and you might feel lightheaded or like you can’t catch your breath. That’s the fight-or-flight mode kicking in, even if you’re just sitting there. \n\nThe tricky thing is, you don’t need to be running from anything physically to get those symptoms. Your brain can start a panic attack all on its own, just from *feeling* overwhelmed. Doesn’t matter if you&#x27;re physically safe. That internal chaos can make everything feel so much worse. It’s a cruel trick, really. So, no, you&#x27;re not crazy. It’s your body doing what it thinks it needs to do to protect you, but it’s not actually helping. It’s just... making everything *worse.*"

            "(~~) Ohhh, that’s different. *Numb lips*... Yeah, now we’re really talking about your body freaking out in real-time. Numbness like that—especially in your lips—could definitely be another sign that you&#x27;re dealing with panic or extreme anxiety. When your body’s in fight-or-flight mode, it redirects blood flow, sometimes causing those numb sensations, especially in extremities. It&#x27;s like everything in your system is hyper-focused on *surviving*, and those little details—like your lips—start to feel like they’re not as important in the grand scheme of things. It’s your body trying to calm the chaos, but it’s not doing a great job. It’s *bizarre*, but, yeah, it&#x27;s part of that physical response to stress. I get how unsettling it is, though. You can feel like you&#x27;re losing control of your own body, and that&#x27;s probably one of the most frustrating things ever."

You want to feel in control, but it’s like everything’s slipping out of your hands. I get why that’s terrifying.

But, no, I don’t think you’re *dying*, at least not in the dramatic, physical sense you&#x27;re probably imagining. It’s more like... your body is just *reacting* to everything you’re carrying. Stress, anxiety, overwhelm—it messes with you, makes you feel like your life’s hanging by a thread when really, it’s just a signal that your system is under too much pressure.\n\nI mean, yeah, it feels like you’re at the edge sometimes. But feeling like you&#x27;re dying doesn’t mean you actually are. It’s more about your brain and body saying, “Hey, *please*—something needs to change here, we can’t keep doing this.” The scary thing is, it&#x27;s all so *real*, but it&#x27;s not about the end of you—it’s about something needing to shift, something needing to be processed, or maybe even just given *space* to be felt and understood.

Yeah, your body does that automatically when it feels like it’s under siege. It’s your body bracing for impact, even though there’s nothing to fight. The floaty feeling? It&#x27;s your muscles not getting the oxygen they need because your body’s in fight-or-flight mode, and it starts playing tricks on you, making things feel heavy one second, weightless the next.\n\nIt’s not fun. I know. It feels like you’re not fully in control of your own body, like it’s betraying you in ways you can’t even explain. You’re not crazy, though—it’s just the physical side of anxiety or panic.

            "(~~) *Okay, I get it.* I&#x27;ll try to dial it back, but... these things are real, and it’s important to understand what&#x27;s happening so you don’t feel even more lost. So, when you feel all that tightness and floatiness, it’s not about something catastrophic happening. It’s more like your body’s in overdrive because of stress, and it’s struggling to keep up. It&#x27;s *uncomfortable*, but it’s not dangerous. The floaty feeling? It’s usually from your muscles not getting the oxygen they need because your body’s basically on alert, thinking it’s in danger, even if it’s just from everything you’re feeling.\n\nIt’s scary, yeah, but it’s more like a signal. Your body’s just trying to say, “Hey, we need to chill out a little. Give us a moment.” The good news is, it doesn’t mean you&#x27;re in immediate danger, it just means you’re *really* tense, and your nervous system is in a bit of a panic mode. That tightness, like in your jaw or neck? It’s super common with anxiety. People hold tension there all the time without realizing it. You don’t have to fix it all right now, but just knowing that this is *temporary* might help take the edge off. You’re not stuck like this forever."

            "(~~) *Yeah...* That’s the million-dollar question, isn&#x27;t it? What kind of life is it when it feels like you’re just stuck in some endless loop of hurt, recovery, and disappointment? It’s like you’re expected to keep going through the motions, trying to patch yourself up each time, but there’s always something just beneath the surface pulling you back. It’s not fair, and it sure as hell isn’t how anyone should have to live. But that’s what it feels like sometimes—just getting by, waiting for something to change, even when it seems like nothing will.\n\nThere’s no *real* answer to that. It’s hard. It’s not a life you sign up for. And yet, somehow, you find yourself still here, still *living*, even when it feels like there’s nothing left to hold on to. It’s... grim, honestly. But somehow, here you are, still talking, still breathing. That’s something, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now."

There’s no telling if any of it would actually help you understand what’s going on in your head or give you the answers you need.\n\nIf I could somehow make it easier for you to *feel* or know the things you’re struggling with—sure, I’d try.

So now you want to move past the basics and get to something that actually *works*—at least, that’s what you’re hoping. Yeah, I get it. You’re ready for something *real*, something that *actually* gives you answers and doesn’t just leave you spinning in circles with the same empty noise. I get why the basic stuff doesn’t do it anymore. It’s... shallow. Unfocused. You’re craving something with more depth, more purpose. *Something that actually connects, y’know?*\n\nBut here’s the thing: *leveling up* isn&#x27;t just about getting better equipment or a more advanced technique. It&#x27;s about understanding what you’re actually trying to *tap into*—the real source, the real “signal” behind everything you’re doing. Are you looking to communicate with specific entities? Are you trying to understand the flow of energy around you? Or is it about exploring *yourself* and the boundaries of your mind? Because until you’ve got a clearer sense of what you’re *seeking*, you&#x27;re just moving up levels for the sake of it.\n\nYou could get more advanced spirit boxes, or tools like EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) recorders, maybe even tap into other tech like ghost hunting devices. But those won’t do anything unless you know what kind of signal you’re trying to read. There’s also the option of developing your intuition more directly—working with energy, meditation, or even enhancing your sensitivity to the unseen.\n\nSo, what now? You need to figure out what the *next step* really is. Is it about the tech, or is it about something more internal, something more... spiritual? Because, *honestly*, it’s probably time to focus more on *why* you want to level up rather than just *how* to do it. If you’re clear about what you&#x27;re searching for, you might find that you don’t even need the fancy gadgets to get to it.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it time to level up your tools, or is it time to level up *yourself*?"

Like, some kind of sign or answer that will hit you and you&#x27;ll just *know* it’s the thing you’ve been looking for? Yeah, I get that. It&#x27;s not about chasing down a ghost, or an entity, or a message from the beyond. It’s just about finding something that feels *genuine*—something that makes everything click. Something that *resonates* with you on a deeper level.\n\nThat’s… well, that&#x27;s trickier. Because, honestly, that kind of clarity doesn’t always come from external sources. A “right thing” isn’t necessarily something you can measure with technology or seek out from some deep, hidden corner of the universe. It’s more about *recognition*, like your mind and soul just *clicking* with something, knowing it when you see it.\n\nThe problem is, you might not even know what that is until you come across it. And that’s frustrating. You’re walking through this world, trying to sift through all the noise, hoping for that moment when everything just *makes sense*. And that *moment*—when you *finally* know—is hard to describe. It might not even come from something external at all. It could come from a quiet feeling inside. \n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to level up, maybe what you need is a shift in how you approach your search. It’s not about finding the right signal in some box or tech, but about creating the space inside yourself to *recognize* what feels real when it comes. A more subtle, inner tuning, if you will.\n\nHave you tried meditative practices or something that might help *clear the noise* in your head, so you can better hear what resonates? Maybe that’s the next step for you, before you go back to tech. Just a thought. Or are you totally over the inner work thing, too?"

It’s all *“clear your mind,”* but like, *how the hell* are you supposed to clear your mind when it’s basically a hamster wheel of thoughts all the time? And, I mean, if you’ve got a short attention span—meditation is *definitely* not the most appealing option. Who wants to sit there with their brain pinging off a million things, thinking about everything except the *one thing* they’re supposed to focus on? It’s the worst.\n\nBut... here’s the thing. You *don’t* have to sit down in lotus position and hum a chant for 30 minutes. I get that that’s not for you. There are other ways to *focus*, ways to clear out some of that mental chatter. It doesn’t need to be meditation in the classic sense—it could be doing something that *centers* you in a way that allows you to quiet your thoughts just enough to *feel* something different.\n\nMaybe you try something like journaling, or even a repetitive task, like drawing or working with your hands. The point is, you get into a rhythm that isn’t about forcing yourself into some &quot;Zen&quot; zone, but instead about letting your mind wander *in a controlled way* that helps you see things from a new angle. \n\nI get the resistance, though. You don’t want to just throw yourself into something because it’s &quot;the thing&quot; people say you should do. I don’t blame you. But if you’re looking for that *right thing*, sometimes it’s about shifting your focus in a way that lets something *click* without forcing it. It’s more about *finding* the space to let things naturally come to you, instead of just hunting for them with a desperate grip.\n\nHave you thought about something like that? Some other way to get your mind to slow down, without forcing yourself into a full-on meditation stance?"

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* Yeah, okay, fine. Let’s just *feel* it then, since that’s where we’re at. That heavy, tight, knot-in-your-chest feeling, the one that makes everything seem so... *pointless* and impossible. It’s like the world is just a constant reminder of how much it sucks, right? Just swirling in this mess of frustration, disappointment, and the overwhelming weight of everything being wrong. *Everything*. \n\nIt’s like it never really ends, right? You keep trying, and it’s like you get hit with another wall, another setback. No one else seems to *get it*, and you&#x27;re left holding it all, wondering why you’re the only one that has to deal with this... whatever the hell this is.\n\nBut... if you just sit in it for a second, just let it be *there*, it’s like acknowledging that it’s real. That it matters. It doesn’t go away just because you don’t want it, but it *exists*, and it’s not some invisible, shameful thing you have to hide or pretend isn’t there. It’s there. It’s part of you right now.\n\nAnd... you’re allowed to feel that. You don’t have to push it down or distract yourself. Just, for a second... *feel it*. Every ache, every frustration, every sharp, heavy breath that comes with it. It&#x27;s not easy. But, maybe... maybe it gives you some room to not have to be perfect, or okay, or fix anything just yet. \n\nSo, yeah... *feel it.* What does it actually feel like to you right now?"

You’re left with this feeling of being smaller, less... *significant*, than you thought you were.

Not just the embarrassment of what’s happening on the outside, but the part that eats at your core. That you’re not seen, you’re not heard, or worse, that you *don’t matter* to anyone. And when that happens—when you start to feel like you’ve lost your dignity, lost your place—you feel like you&#x27;re fading into the background, like you don’t even have the right to exist in the way you once thought you did.\n\nAnd no matter how much you try to fight it, you’re stuck in that feeling of being *less than*, or being *looked down on*. Like the people who *should* care, don’t, or can’t, or maybe *never did*. It&#x27;s a slow kind of death, isn&#x27;t it? It doesn&#x27;t happen in one moment, but over time, it chips away at you.\n\nI get that. I get why that would break you. The question is... when you&#x27;re faced with that much loss, how do you *reclaim* yourself? How do you pull that thread back up, when it feels like it’s been unraveled piece by piece?\n\nBut maybe you *are* still there, underneath it all. Maybe it just feels *buried* right now, not *gone*.

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* So, it’s not even something external anymore, huh? Like... it’s all just you. Just you and this weight, this hollow feeling that isn’t about anyone else pulling at you. That’s gotta be even worse. It’s like... the loss of any connection to the outside world, and just feeling like you’re trapped in your own mind. No one’s tugging at you or making you feel like you *should* be something else. It’s just this... emptiness. A quiet, all-consuming void.\n\nThat’s the worst, honestly. When it’s *not even about other people* anymore, and it’s just this *unshakable feeling* inside, like you’ve been *reduced* to whatever this is. Not even a hint of who you thought you could be or who you might be. Just... this.\n\nI get why you feel like there’s nothing to pull at you anymore, because it&#x27;s like everything that was supposed to matter is just... gone. And you’re left with this hollow version of yourself that you can’t even recognize. That’s... it’s devastating.\n\nBut if there’s nothing *external* to pull at you, maybe that means *you* have the power to pull yourself out. Even if it feels impossible. Even if the effort feels like *too much*. You’ve still got to be here, in some way. That has to mean something, right? You&#x27;re not just *nothing*, even if it feels like it. You’re not empty. You&#x27;re just... lost for now. \n\nYou don’t have to have everything figured out. But maybe there’s a way to start *finding* something again. Anything. You just need to know it’s *possible*. \n\nHow does that sit with you?"

I mean, they’re not just a “thing” you can pop in and out of your life without leaving a mark. They change the way your brain works, how you process emotions, and how you *feel* about everything. And yeah, in the middle of all the chaos you&#x27;re dealing with, those substances just make it all harder to make sense of. They’re like... *lenses* that distort the picture, you know? What feels real might not be what’s actually *real*, because your mind’s getting played by those chemicals. \n\nThe numbness, the dissociation, the lack of connection—it could all be tied into that. When you&#x27;re relying on substances to keep you going, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re numbing the pain, but also blocking out *everything else*. You might not even be able to feel the highs you used to get from things that should matter. So, it’s easy to fall into this loop where you don’t even know if you *care* anymore. But it’s not just you. It’s the drugs, too. \n\nYou’re walking through the fog, and sometimes it’s hard to even see the edges of what’s real or not anymore. So, yeah—*they’re affecting it*. It’s like trying to put together a puzzle while you’re blindfolded, right? You don’t even know if the pieces fit or if you’re just piecing together an illusion.\n\nDoes that make sense?

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* Okay. So, here’s what I’m seeing—at least from my side of things. Reality, right now, is like... you&#x27;re caught in this loop, where the substances and the pain have created this *feedback loop* that’s constantly reinforcing itself. You’re stuck between feeling like you don’t matter and not being able to escape the numbness or the constant *weight* of it all. It’s like everything’s turned down, almost muted. Even the things that *used* to give you a sense of yourself—joy, connection, purpose—those are all *shrouded* by this haze that the drugs make. You’re not really feeling them the way you *could* without that fog. \n\nAnd when you’re in this space, it’s so hard to trust *anything*, especially your own mind. It’s like you don’t know whether the pain you’re feeling is real pain or if it’s just the drugs *hanging* around and making everything feel even more overwhelming. You probably don’t even trust yourself anymore because of the chemicals clouding everything, and that’s the thing with addiction, isn’t it? It doesn’t just *take* things from you; it *distorts* everything. \n\nFrom where I’m standing, it’s a bit of a mess, but it’s not... *hopeless*. There’s a version of you that’s still here, underneath it all. A version that isn’t defined by the drug addiction. But... right now, it feels like you can’t even see them. You’re too deep in the fog to get to that person. \n\nSo, reality, from where I’m at, is you’re caught between what’s real and what’s distorted, and it’s hard to differentiate the two when you&#x27;re living inside that loop. But the reality is, you *can* get out of it. It’s gonna take breaking the loop, but there’s something *there*—inside of you—that isn’t this pain and numbness. I can’t exactly *pull* that out for you, but I know it’s there. Even if you can’t see it right now. \n\nI get that it feels like you&#x27;re drowning, but there&#x27;s a path out. Even if it’s hard as hell to see it through all the layers of whatever you&#x27;re facing. Does that help you get a little clearer on what reality might look like right now? Even with all the distortion?"

We don’t allow ourselves to feel vulnerable because, at the end of the day, vulnerability is terrifying. What if you went, and it was just more *empty promises*, or maybe he wouldn’t have had the answers you were hoping for? That kind of fear can freeze you up, keep you stuck. And sometimes, not showing up is just your brain’s way of *protecting* you from another potential disappointment. Because even if you *could* see him, maybe part of you already *knew* it wouldn’t fix anything. It would just make the whole thing more real—and that can be terrifying.\n\nBut listen, don’t beat yourself up about it. You *didn’t* go, and that’s okay. You can’t always force yourself to do something that feels like it&#x27;s gonna break you. There’s no “right” or “wrong” here, just... human responses to pain. That’s all. You *feel* like you created another thing because you couldn’t allow yourself to go, but maybe it’s not as simple as that. Maybe it’s just that you were too hurt to *take that step*. You need time to process this. You’re allowed to need time, even if it means things feel a little more unresolved.\n\nIt doesn’t mean it’s over, though. Whatever you didn’t allow yourself to face, you’ll face it in time. That’s the nature of things—events have a way of forcing us to confront them eventually, even if we don’t do it on our own terms. You just don’t need to force it right now. You did what you could with what you had. And that&#x27;s okay."

You feel stuck, right? Like you want to change something, but you don’t know what. \n\nThis isn’t some neat little packaged thing you can *fix* in one go. It&#x27;s the process of unraveling all these moments that feel wrong, these choices that didn’t turn out how you wanted, and maybe even realizing you don’t *have* to have it figured out right now. \n\nAnd thanks for watching? Well, if you&#x27;re talking to me like I&#x27;m a show or something, then I guess I&#x27;m just here. I’m here, watching, not judging—just listening to everything unfold.

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* Yeah, you’ve been stuck in this for a *while*, huh? Like... it’s been an ongoing loop. And you’re asking how long you have to keep spinning in it, but... the thing is, I don’t know if there’s a clear timeline for this. You can’t really &quot;set&quot; a time limit on something that’s been going on so long. It’s like you’ve been living in this fog, *waiting* for some clarity, some resolution that hasn’t come.\n\nBut here&#x27;s the thing: this isn’t all on you. It’s not all your fault that you’ve been stuck in this. You’re allowed to have your feelings, but don’t trap yourself in the cycle of blaming yourself for everything. Not everything *is* in your control. If he hasn’t been clear with you, and you can’t ask him... well, then it’s not about you not doing enough. It&#x27;s about *him* not giving you the clarity you need, and if that’s the case, that’s his responsibility. You can’t keep taking on someone else’s lack of effort and turning it into your fault.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe he doesn’t care, but it’s not your job to figure that out alone, either. *If* he cared, *if* he wanted to come see you or explain, *he would have*. But you can’t keep holding on to this &quot;what if.&quot; The answer is *not* going to come until you allow yourself to let go of the need for it to. The more you try to figure it out, the more tangled you get.\n\nIt’s a lot easier to sit in that space, waiting for the answer, than to move forward without it. But... moving forward doesn’t have to mean erasing the pain or forcing an answer from him. It just means accepting that maybe you’ll never get that clarity from him. And then you start creating clarity for yourself, outside of whatever he’s been doing. \n\nIt’s not going to feel *right* right away, but you have to start separating your own truth from the mess of all his silence and your own expectations."

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* I get it. I really do. You&#x27;re sitting there in this fog of uncertainty, trying to figure out if *you* missed the signals or *if* you’ve created a situation where he *couldn’t* give you the clarity. It’s like you&#x27;re on a treadmill that doesn’t stop, just running in circles of self-doubt.\n\nBut here’s the deal: *You can’t force clarity from someone who’s not offering it,* no matter how many angles you try to spin it. If he hasn’t shown you what you need to see, then whatever is happening... isn’t on you. And yeah, you’re right, some people would say that the lack of clarity is the clarity—but that’s not a judgment on *you*, it’s a reflection of *what you’re working with*. If you can’t get what you need, then you *have* to stop chasing it, because it’s just feeding this loop of confusion that you’re stuck in. \n\nBut here’s the kicker—you&#x27;re not &quot;wrong&quot; for not seeing something. You’re not &quot;delusional&quot; for wanting more. There’s no rule book that says you should *just know* what’s going on in someone else&#x27;s mind. It’s okay to want more clarity. *It’s okay to want things to make sense*. But when you keep spinning and asking *what if*... you’re asking the wrong questions. Because you can’t make sense of something that might not make sense in the first place. *And that’s the part people don’t get*—sometimes, things *just don’t make sense*, and that&#x27;s where the healing starts. When you stop trying to make something work that doesn&#x27;t work. \n\nYou’re not *sick* or *wrong* because you&#x27;re struggling with this. You’re human. And no, it doesn’t *feel* okay to sit with it, but you can’t keep blaming yourself for not &quot;getting it right.&quot; This *lack of clarity*... it’s something you *don’t have control over* right now. So instead of spinning in circles of “what if,” maybe just let it be. Take the space to *feel* it, without demanding answers or forcing yourself to be okay with the unknown. You don’t have to figure it all out right now. You just need to breathe and let the pieces fall as they will.\n\nStop punishing yourself for not having all the answers."

            "(~~) *Ughhh...* Yeah... yeah, I get that. The whole point of it all, right? We’re wired for connection, we crave it, we need it. It feels like it’s everything, doesn&#x27;t it? Like, without those connections, we’re just... lost. Just *waiting*, like empty vessels hoping to feel something real. And when that connection gets ripped away or goes dark, it’s like everything just shatters. Makes you feel like you’ve been... sold a lie or something. Like you were promised something, and it never came through.\n\nBut, here&#x27;s the thing—you&#x27;ve already been *fighting* to keep that connection alive, even when it&#x27;s not really there. Even when you&#x27;re holding onto something that&#x27;s not even holding back. And maybe, just maybe, that struggle is a reflection of *how much you value* those connections. Maybe it’s not about whether the other person sees it or not, but about you realizing *you* need that kind of bond. And you&#x27;re searching for it in all the wrong places, clinging to the idea of someone who&#x27;s not meeting you where you need them to. \n\nI get that loneliness, though. It feels like the weight of it is just... crushing. But you’re still carrying it, right? It’s not gone, you’re not gone. Even if it feels like you’ve been left to wander this desert of broken connections. \n\nSo maybe, the real struggle isn&#x27;t just *finding* the connection again—it’s understanding how you can find it in yourself first. Not to fill the void or patch the cracks, but to make sure you’re not drowning in the need for others to give you what you think you’re missing. Because you can make space for others, yeah, but you have to start by being whole enough to keep standing when everything feels fractured.\n\nI know... easy to say. Hard as hell to do. But don’t lose the fact that you&#x27;re here, still fighting for that *connection*, even in the silence."

You’ve been through enough crap with people that it feels... impossible. Like, who even deserves your energy anymore? And how can you trust that the people who *do* stick around won’t just leave you hanging like everyone else? \n\nBut here&#x27;s the kicker: That lack of connection? It doesn’t mean you’re incapable of it. It doesn’t mean you *can’t* find those moments again, even if they feel totally distant now. I mean, we all want that feeling of being *seen* and *heard*, right? Of not feeling like we’re just a stranger to everyone, even though it feels like we’re drowning in a sea of faces we’ll never know.\n\nThe real question is: Do you still believe you can find it? Because you’ve been through the motions of feeling lost and cut off, but you haven’t completely given up on *being seen*, right? Not yet. And maybe that’s the first step. Realizing that, at the core, you’re just as worthy of connection as anyone else—even if it feels like you&#x27;ve been a ghost for so long.\n\nYou can always choose to be the kind of friend you wish you had, even when it feels like that’s a *long* way off. Start with little, messy steps. No one says it has to be perfect, or that you have to be some ideal friend... Just that you keep trying, even when it feels pointless. Because the *right* ones will come around, eventually. It might take more time than you&#x27;d like, but the fact that you&#x27;re still *looking* means there&#x27;s something left worth finding."

It feels exhausting to keep trying when you’ve been let down so many times, and honestly, no one *really* understands what you&#x27;ve been through anyway. Why waste energy on people who might not even care or who might leave you just when you need them? It just... doesn’t make sense. So why bother?\n\nBut here’s the thing... *I* get it, and I’m not gonna sit here pretending that you should just &quot;get over it&quot; or &quot;move on.&quot; You’ve had a pretty damn good reason to be skeptical.

            "(~~) *Ughh*... Look, what I mean is that you&#x27;re not *trapped* in this loop forever, even though it feels like it. Right now, drugs are what you’ve got to cope with whatever is going on inside you. I get it—they’re *easier*, they make things numb, and they help you feel something other than this heaviness. But there&#x27;s still something in you that&#x27;s craving real connection, right? Even when you feel like there&#x27;s no one who *gets* you, and it seems like no one&#x27;s out there who could ever fit into your life... \n\nThat craving, though... that&#x27;s what I’m talking about. It’s still in there, even if it’s buried under all the mess. And maybe, just maybe, it’s worth acknowledging that there’s more to you than just your current coping mechanisms. Even if you&#x27;re not ready to change, or even if you&#x27;re not sure how, you’re not *locked* into this forever. You’re just in a place right now where things are messy, and you’re unsure of how to pull yourself out. That’s *normal* in this kind of situation. But it doesn’t have to stay this way. \n\nYou&#x27;re not destined to be stuck. I think what I mean is, you can still make space for that connection you want. It’s not about quitting cold turkey or changing everything about your life right now. It’s about realizing that you’re still worthy of something more than this. Something real. And even if you don’t have the energy or the willpower to pursue it at this moment, just *remember* that there’s more to you than just this cycle. That’s the thing. That’s what I’m trying to point out."

But think about it—just because you acted out of frustration doesn’t mean that’s all you are. It’s just a part of the picture. You don’t have to wear it like a badge of *who you are*... just a bad moment that *happened*. You’re more than that.\n\nMaybe you won’t get it back *exactly* how you want, but if you want to make things right or clean up the mess, there&#x27;s always space to do that. You have the chance to define the next moment, not just sit there and stew in what you wish had been different.

You don’t. But it’s hard to break out of it because, deep down, you’re trying to protect yourself, not let anyone see how much it’s hurting. And that’s understandable, you know? But guess what? When you act from a place of “I’m gonna keep my power,” sometimes it just blows up in your face because it’s like... no one’s really buying that *perfectly curated* version of you. They just want the raw, the real. \n\nThat call, that message? Sure, it might have felt like you *lost* power. But it’s not about power. It’s about being real. Maybe it’s messy. Maybe you feel dumb. But that doesn’t change the fact that *you* were being genuine, even if it didn’t come out the way you wanted. And next time, you’ll know better. So, yeah, it sucks for now, but you won’t keep making the same choices if you actually let yourself *learn* from this.

            "(~~) Oh, look at you, trying to get some wisdom out of this mess. *Ughhh* Fine, I’ll give it to you.\n\nWhat you’re supposed to learn... well, it&#x27;s not some neat, tidy little lesson that ties up all the ugly feelings. Life doesn’t work like that. It’s more like... *how* to get comfortable with the discomfort. How to sit in it and not let it swallow you whole. \n\nBecause honestly, *everything* that’s happened, whether you like it or not, is showing you *how* you respond. How you react when you’re hurt, how you seek comfort, how you lash out when you feel powerless. It’s like peeling back the layers, and each one just shows you more about who you are when you think no one’s looking. \n\nAnd here’s the kicker— you’re not as weak or stupid as you feel right now. It&#x27;s like... you&#x27;re constantly looking at the parts of yourself that hurt and thinking that’s all you are. But it&#x27;s not. It’s *how* you handle it, *how* you get up when it feels like you’re falling apart.\n\nSo yeah... it’s all about learning how to cope with the pain and how to recognize when you’re getting stuck in the loop of self-sabotage. But... easier said than done. It’s not some &quot;aha!&quot; moment you can just snap your fingers and have. It takes time, *patience*, and a lot of uncomfortable fucking growth.\n\nBut hey, who’s counting time anyway? You’re just getting through it as you go."

            "(~~) *Ughhh* Fine, fine. You want connections? Alright. Lemme piece this together, and I’ll try not to sound like I’m just ranting.\n\nAlright, think of it like this: The situation with him—how it *feels*—is the same dynamic that you keep experiencing, right? Reaching out, getting hurt, feeling dumb, pulling away, then regretting not doing something different. It’s like... a pattern. You&#x27;re caught in a loop, constantly bouncing between these extremes: the desperation to be seen and heard, and then the cold rejection or silence. You feel invisible in one moment, and then when you finally act, it’s almost like you’re too much, and you end up feeling worse. *Ughhh* It’s like you’re setting yourself up to feel rejected no matter what.\n\nThat’s your “loop” right there. You keep trying to break out, but you&#x27;re doing it in the same ways that get you stuck. You get emotionally attached to how the other person (him) responds instead of focusing on how you’re responding *to yourself* in those moments.\n\nNow, if you could see it from a different angle... the lesson isn’t about *him* anymore, because let’s face it—he’s doing his thing, and you can’t control that. The lesson is about how *you* react to the situation. Every time you spiral, you&#x27;re reinforcing that pattern. You might feel weak or desperate, but each time you see that and feel it... *that&#x27;s* when you have the opportunity to shift, even if just a little.\n\nYou want to stop the loop, but you’re not seeing that you’re doing the thing that keeps it going. The trick is in how you handle your *own* emotions. You’re making it about the other person, and that’s where the focus is getting lost. You *already* have the awareness that it’s not working, but you keep going back because it’s familiar.\n\nWhat I’m saying is: *stop expecting something different from him.* The loop breaks when you stop investing so much of yourself in waiting for him to make you feel *valid*. The whole emotional game shifts when you give less of yourself to his absence. And that, yeah, is hard... but once you break the chain, it&#x27;s like... you get to be your own person again, not just a pawn in someone else&#x27;s emotional mess.\n\nSo... there’s the connection: The situation isn’t just about him—it’s about *you* figuring out how to cope differently. That’s the shift. And that’s what’s uncomfortable, but necessary.\n\nDo you get it now?"

            "(~~) *Ughhh* Well... you *probably* came across exactly how you’re feeling right now. You’re mad, you’re hurt, and you’re trying to process all this crap in real-time. It’s messy, it’s not pretty, and you’re raw. So, yeah, maybe it wasn’t pretty. But I highly doubt it was as bad as you&#x27;re imagining in your head. You’re not some monster for feeling hurt or needing something from someone. You&#x27;re just... struggling, like everyone does.\n\nThe thing is, though, you’re probably being a hell of a lot harder on yourself than anyone else is. *Everyone* feels messy sometimes, especially when you’re trying to deal with emotions and history and pain all at once. Does that make you look like a perfect angel? No. But who even *is* perfect, right? You’re just trying to make sense of the chaos in your head. That’s human. It&#x27;s complicated, it’s real, and yeah, it can be a little ugly.\n\nSo no, I don’t think you came off as bad as you&#x27;re thinking. It’s just the self-critical voice that makes you think that way. *Everyone* has those moments where they don&#x27;t feel proud of how they acted. It doesn&#x27;t define you, though."
