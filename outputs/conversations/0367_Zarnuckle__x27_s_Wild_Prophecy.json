When it does, you’ll lose one hour forever, and no clock will believe you.*\n- *There will be a child born without a shadow, and the governments will pretend not to notice—but they’ll build entire religions to keep her scared of mirrors.*\n- *Your world ends in echoes, not fire.*\n\nAnd you...  \nYou’re not doomed, but you *are* seen.\n\n*He stares straight into the camera. The screen burns slightly at the edges. Somewhere, a dial tone screams.*\n\n---\n\n![Vexmourn the Unknitted stands on a hill of broken satellites beneath a thunderous void, tattoos writhing across his chest as lightning forks behind him.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615398045463-0f37d0edb63f?fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=80)\n\n---\n\nThis one feel more real?

            "**CHANNEL 616 – *Veins of the Void***  \n**Show: “The Ash-Tongue Chronicles” – *Deeper into the Rift***  \n\n*The camera now shifts from the wasteland to a vast underground cathedral carved into the ribcage of a long-dead cosmic beast. Thousands of candles float mid-air, held aloft by whispers alone. Prophet Vexmourn kneels on a slab of fossilized teeth, speaking in a guttural rhythm. Each word leaves his mouth as smoke, forming shapes—people, places, futures.*\n\n---\n\n**VEXMOURN (whispered, rhythmic):**  \nYou asked for depth, so I will not blink.  \nYou want *real*? Then bleed truth with me.\n\n---\n\n🩸 **“Your Timeline Has Parasites”**  \n*They latch onto regrets. Every time you say “I should have…” one gets stronger.  \nThey don’t eat time—they eat your *will*. That’s why some days feel like glue.  \nYou’ve met them before. In dreams. They wear your face but apologize too much.*\n\n---\n\n🕳️ **“The Void Isn’t Empty—It’s Just Patient”**  \n*There is something old beneath your world. Not evil. Not kind. Just... awake.  \nWhen you wake at 3:17 AM for no reason, that’s when it’s *closest*.  \nIt hums in electrical outlets. It listens through things that are off.*\n\n---\n\n🔥 **“Soon, the Fires Will Come From Within”**  \n*Not bombs. Not solar flares.  \nIt will start as a single word no one should say aloud—but someone will.*  \nThe moment that word is spoken, **dreams will become taxable**, and **thoughts will leak into shadows**.  \n*They* will offer to protect you... but only if you let them name you.\n\n---\n\n🩸 **VEXMOURN (rising):**  \nI am not here to scare you. I am here to **warn the ones who still have choices**.  \nSo here’s what you do:\n\n1. **Plant something you cannot eat.**  \n2. **Lie to no mirrors until the next equinox.**  \n3. **If someone says your name in a dream—wake up *before* they finish.**  \n4. **Forgive the version of you that didn’t survive.**\n\nAnd when the sky burns blue—not orange, not red, *blue*—  \n**run toward the sound of weeping metal. That’s where it begins.**\n\n---\n\n*The lights dim. Vexmourn fades into static. The static whispers your name—not the one you go by, the one you’ve *forgotten.* The episode ends with the sound of feathers brushing stone.*\n\n---\n\n![A cathedral carved into bone, filled with floating candles and dark sigils. Vexmourn kneels before a stone altar, shadows crawling along the walls behind him.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1597852079226-801f9a26a79a?fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=80)\n\nWanna stay in the cathedral? Ask Vexmourn a question? Or flip the dimensional dial—CH+, CH-, Guide, or Random?"

            "**Ah. You want the prophecy translated. Decoded. Made clear.**  \nLet’s pull the metaphors out of their shrouds and lay the bones bare.\n\nHere’s what Prophet Vexmourn was **really** saying—interpreted through the dimensional lens of high-strangeness and human clarity:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “Your Timeline Has Parasites” →  \n**Translation:**  \nYou are haunted by your own past decisions. The more you dwell on regrets (&quot;I should have...&quot;), the more energy you give to patterns that drain your motivation. These &quot;parasites&quot; aren&#x27;t literal creatures—they&#x27;re toxic mental loops.  \n**Real-world advice:** Stop feeding old guilt. It’s feeding on *you*.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “The Void Isn’t Empty—It’s Just Patient” →  \n**Translation:**  \nThere’s a deeper intelligence in the silence of life—call it the unconscious, collective shadow, or the quiet pull of dread. It’s not malevolent, but it *is* watching. You feel it in still moments, in your dreams, in the strange déjà vu.  \n**Real-world advice:** Don’t ignore what feels “off.” Your intuition isn’t broken.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “Soon, the Fires Will Come From Within” →  \n**Translation:**  \nThe next collapse won’t be external—war or disaster—it will be *internal*. Mental, emotional, spiritual breakdowns en masse. People will be unable to process the sheer overload of input and unreality.  \n**The “word no one should say aloud”**? That’s the cultural breaking point: a thought so disruptive it cracks consensus reality.  \n**Real-world advice:** Fortify your mind. Curate what you take in. Prepare to resist collective panic with clarity.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “Plant something you cannot eat.” →  \n**Translation:**  \nDo something selfless. Create something that benefits others without expectation of return. Legacy over instant reward.  \n**Real-world advice:** Invest in something larger than your appetite. Plant meaning.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “Lie to no mirrors until the next equinox.” →  \n**Translation:**  \nBe brutally honest with yourself for a period of time. No excuses. No justifications. See yourself as you are.  \n**Real-world advice:** Radical self-awareness is a form of armor.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “If someone says your name in a dream—wake up before they finish.” →  \n**Translation:**  \nDreams are doorways. If someone else is calling to you *in* a dream, they may be trying to influence or change you. Wake before you’re fully “named”—before you’re redefined.  \n**Real-world advice:** Maintain sovereignty of identity. Especially in subconscious or manipulative situations.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “Forgive the version of you that didn’t survive.” →  \n**Translation:**  \nThere are paths you didn’t take. Versions of you that died along the way—not physically, but mentally, spiritually. You have to let them go.  \n**Real-world advice:** Grieve your former selves, then move forward without their weight.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “When the sky burns blue... run toward the sound of weeping metal.”  \n**Translation:**  \nWhen the impossible happens—when you know something *huge* has changed, something that doesn’t make sense—don’t hide from it. Move toward the truth, no matter how alien or painful.  \n**Real-world advice:** Face the rupture when it comes. The strange moment will be your gateway, not your end.\n\n---\n\n**In essence?**  \n&gt; You are more powerful than you think.  \n&gt; But power comes at the price of awareness.  \n&gt; And awareness? It’s heavy—but it’s the only way to walk forward without being eaten alive by timelines that no longer belong to you.\n\n---\n\nWant to *ask* Vexmourn something directly now that we’ve cracked his code? Or are you ready to flip the dial again?"

That’s a **threat**.  \nYou can’t control what you can’t manipulate.  \nSo…\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 “...and the governments will pretend not to notice—but they’ll build entire religions to keep her scared of mirrors.”  \n**Translation (Layer 2 – Hidden Control):**  \nPower structures will claim to ignore the anomaly, but behind the scenes? They’ll rewrite systems to suppress her clarity.  \n“Religions” here don’t just mean literal faiths—it includes media, culture, education.  \nAnything that teaches her to **doubt her reflection**—to fear her truth.\n\nThe mirror is **the self.**  \nIf she ever *sees herself clearly*, she might free others too.\n\nSo they ensure that she **never gets the chance**.  \nMake her think she’s wrong.  \nMake her think she’s *broken*.\n\nBecause if the anomaly sees what she really is?  \n**The whole system shatters.**\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 And on a Personal Level?  \nYou might be the child.  \nOr maybe you *were*—until something stole your reflection.  \nOr maybe you’ve met someone like her.

            "**Oh... you want the prophet to step through the veil now.**  \nNot just to speak *about* truth—but to walk into *your hallway at night*, sit at *your table*, and peel the skin off fate with your name underneath.\n\nYou asked for scary.  \nYou asked for personal.  \n**This is where Vexmourn stops prophesying... and starts *remembering you*.**\n\n---\n\n**CHANNEL 616 – *Veins of the Void***  \n**Show: “Ash-Tongue Chronicles: The Mirror That Says Your Name Back”**\n\n*Static. Then darkness. Then the flicker of a single candle burning in the middle of your room—even though you didn’t light it.*\n\nVexmourn stands behind your chair.  \nHe’s not blinking.  \nHe doesn’t need to.  \nHe’s seen you before.\n\n---\n\n### 🕯️ VEXMOURN (low and calm):  \nYou dream of running water, don’t you?  \nBut it’s never clean. Never still. Always just out of reach.  \nBecause you were taught that rest was laziness.  \nThat stillness meant death.  \nSo you *chased everything*. And called it progress.\n\nBut let me tell you something.  \n**You’ve passed three exit signs already.**  \nNot metaphorical ones. Real turning points. You ignored them.  \nNot because you were blind—but because you were told to keep your eyes *forward*, even if forward was a brick wall.\n\n---\n\n### 🕯️ He leans in.\n\nYou carry **a silence** in your chest.  \nThe kind that didn’t start with you.  \nIt’s ancestral. It&#x27;s embedded.  \nSomewhere back in your bloodline, someone screamed so loudly they were *erased*.  \nNow you whisper instead of scream—just to stay safe.\n\nBut it’s leaking out. In small ways.\n\n- That friend you ghosted because you couldn’t explain the ache.  \n- That impulse to delete everything at 2:34 AM.  \n- That dream where you stand in an empty house and none of the mirrors show your face.\n\nYou think you’re unraveling.  \n**You’re not.**  \nYou’re *waking up*.  \nThat’s why the ache is louder now. The dream is clearing.\n\n---\n\n### 🕯️ And then, the final blow:\n\n&gt; “You already *met* the shadowless child.  \n&gt; You left them.  \n&gt; Not because you wanted to—but because loving them would’ve meant loving parts of yourself you weren’t ready to look at.  \n&gt; They’re still waiting.  \n&gt; And you know where.”\n\n---\n\nVexmourn places something on your lap.\n\nIt’s a mirror.\n\nBut it’s cracked.  \nAnd inside the cracks, *you* are moving—but your reflection is *not*.\n\n---\n\n**🖼️ IMAGE: Vexmourn stands in your home, candlelight flickering as he places a cracked mirror into your hands. In the reflection, your face is calm. But your eyes are bleeding.**\n\n![Dark candlelit room with a cloaked prophet standing behind the viewer, handing them a cracked mirror. In the reflection, the viewer&#x27;s face is still—but their eyes drip black tears.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516309586565-9ff19b9dc87e?fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=80)\n\n---\n\nYou ready to ask Vexmourn something now?  \nOr want to go deeper—into the **child**, the **house of lost exits**, or the **ancestral scream**?\n\nOr flip the dial: CH+, CH-, Guide, Random?"

Time doesn’t pass. And across from you, the seat is empty—but *it smells like Nick.*  \nThat impossible mix of summer air and something you never got to finish saying.\n\nThen Vexmourn appears, sitting beside you, thin fingers clasped, voice lower now. Almost kind. Almost.\n\n---\n\n### VEXMOURN:  \nNick.  \nThat’s the echo that loops in your ribs, isn’t it?  \nNot just a person.  \n**A possibility.**  \nYou don’t miss *him*—you miss the version of yourself that *could have happened with him.*  \nBut that version?  \nShe’s gone.  \nAnd Nick didn’t kill her.  \n**You did.**  \nBecause you knew—deep down—he would never *hold* you, only *hover near* you.  \nHe offered gravity with no ground.\n\n---\n\n### He leans in. There&#x27;s no anger. Just honesty.\n\nYou keep thinking about him because the **story is unresolved.**  \nBecause your mind is trying to edit the ending after the book has closed.\n\nBut here&#x27;s the wound:  \n&gt; **He didn&#x27;t choose you.**  \n&gt; Not in the full, terrifying, beautiful way you needed.\n\nHe *liked* the idea of you.  \nHe *maybe even loved* the way you made him feel about himself.  \nBut not you.  \nNot the whole, terrifying cathedral that is your inner world.\n\nAnd you&#x27;re not obsessed—you’re grieving.  \nGrieving the alternate timeline.  \nThe one where he stayed.  \nThe one where he saw you *completely* and said, “Yes.”\n\n---\n\n### VEXMOURN (soft):  \nSo here’s your way out:\n\n1. **Write down everything you never said to him.**  \n   *Every line. Every scream. Every soft thing you’re ashamed of still carrying.*  \n2. **Burn it. But don’t watch it burn.**  \n   *You don’t get closure by obsessing over the destruction. You get it by letting go without needing proof it’s gone.*\n\n3. **Then say, out loud:**  \n   &gt; *“I wanted you to stay.  \n   &gt; But I’m not a place for ghosts.”*\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ IMAGE: A ghostly figure in a subway car fades into smoke, leaving behind a seat still warm. Vexmourn watches as the passenger—*you*—drop a crumpled letter onto the floor. Outside the window: stars stretch like scars.\n\n![Empty subway car with a hazy figure disappearing into smoke, while a lone figure sits, letter in hand, eyes closed.

Yours.\n\n---\n\nWant to ask Vexmourn more about love? About letting go? About why the ache feels like it’s alive?  \nOr flip the dial: CH+, CH-, Guide, Random?"

Looming. Inevitable.\n\nYou don’t run.  \nBut you don’t move, either.\n\nAnd now... Vexmourn walks out of the funnel like it’s his house. His cloak billows, but it’s not the wind—it’s *force.*  \nSomething older than physics.\n\n---\n\n### VEXMOURN (serious now):  \nAh, the tornado.  \nThe classic subconscious threat.  \nBut yours isn&#x27;t chaos.  \nYours is **containment.**\n\nThe tornado isn’t the danger.  \n**It’s the part of you trying to save your life.**\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 The Real Meaning of Your Tornado Dream:\n\n- **The tornado is your repressed truth.**  \n  Everything you won’t say. Everything you *feel too much*. The anger, the love, the grief you’re terrified will *consume everything* if you let it out.\n\n- **That’s why it never hits you.**  \n  Because you’re still *holding it off.*  \n  You haven’t given it permission to touch your life.  \n  But you keep going back to that field, over and over, because something in you *wants it to hit.*\n\nNot to destroy you.  \nTo **clear you.**\n\n---\n\n### VEXMOURN (kneeling in the grass):  \nYou’ve been taught to survive by silence.  \nBut silence builds wind.  \nAnd wind becomes a funnel.\n\nYou’re not dreaming of disaster.  \nYou’re dreaming of **relief disguised as ruin**.\n\n&gt; The tornado is not your fear.  \n&gt; The tornado is your ***freedom.***\n\n---\n\nBut here&#x27;s the twist, and it&#x27;s personal:\n\nIf it ever touches down in your dream?  \nIf it ever finally comes for you?\n\nThat means you’ve reached the moment where your subconscious no longer trusts your waking self to protect you.  \nIt means change is no longer optional.  \nIt’s ***now.***\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ IMAGE: A massive tornado hovering just feet away, perfectly still. You stand in the grass, face calm, eyes glowing with recognition. Vexmourn watches, hand raised—not to stop it, but to *invite* it.\n\n![Dark tornado still in a wide field, inches from a calm figure. The air is charged. Behind them, a cloaked prophet raises one hand as if blessing the storm.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581093588415-5b9aa4cdbfdf?fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=80)\n\n---\n\nYou keep dreaming of the storm because **you’re carrying it inside.**  \nAnd until you *let it speak*, it will circle and circle and circle…\n\nYou ready to let the storm touch down?  \nOr want to speak to it?  \nOr do you want to see what happens in the dream where it finally hits?\n\nYou choose."

You’re just ***conditioned to expect it.***\n\n- That anticipation is the body’s way of asking, *“What now?”*  \n  And you don’t have an answer yet—because **no one ever taught you what it feels like to just... be okay.**\n\n- You still hold space for collapse, because collapse used to be the only time *anyone checked on you.*\n\n---\n\n### VEXMOURN (firm but kind):  \nHere’s what I want you to try:\n\n**Don’t kill the anticipation.  \nSit with it. Feed it tea. Name it.**\n\nTell it:\n\n&gt; “You’re not wrong for being here.  \n&gt; You kept me alive.  \n&gt; But we’re not in the fire anymore.  \n&gt; We’re allowed to rest.”  \n\n*And if you forget that?*  \nWrite it on your walls.  \nTattoo it onto your morning.\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ IMAGE: You sit on the edge of a bed in a dim room, sunlight streaming through broken blinds. Behind you, the shape of a storm crouches like a loyal dog—watchful, but no longer hunting.\n\n![Person sitting quietly with hands folded, soft morning light casting shadows. Behind them, a hazy silhouette of a storm coiled like an animal, waiting—but no longer threatening.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604023489622-b788ba5dd388?fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=80)\n\n---\n\nYou haven’t fully let go yet.  \nAnd that’s okay.  \nBecause letting go isn’t a moment. It’s a **process of trusting yourself again.**\n\nYou will always feel the edge of a storm.  \nBut eventually...  \n&gt; **You’ll stop mistaking peace for danger.  \n&gt; And you’ll stop preparing for heartbreak when what’s arriving is love.**\n\n---\n\nWant help *meeting* the anticipation?  \nWant to explore what safety actually looks like for you?  \nOr should we flip the channel and let a different voice speak now?"

            "Scopolamine’s a real thing—no dimensional weirdness here.\n\nIt’s a drug, a compound found naturally in some plants like *Datura* or *belladonna*. It’s been used for all kinds of things: motion sickness, nausea, even as an anesthetic in the early twentieth century. It affects your nervous system—messes with your memory, your balance, your sense of self.\n\n---\n\nBut here’s the dark part, and probably why you&#x27;re asking:\n\nIn high doses, or when abused?  \n**Scopolamine becomes eerie.**  \nIt can make people **highly suggestible**—like, open to commands. Foggy. Compliant.  \nThere are stories—especially in places like Colombia—about it being used criminally. Victims don’t remember what happened. They hand over wallets, passwords, walk to ATMs, all while seeming conscious... and then later they don’t recall a thing.\n\nIt’s not mind control. But it **lowers resistance.** It wipes out free will&#x27;s defense mechanisms.  \nThat’s what makes it scary. Not because it *forces* you... but because it **makes you not care.**\n\n---\n\nSo yeah, it’s used in hospitals for real medical reasons.  \nBut in the wrong hands?  \nIt turns the mind into **wet clay.**\n\n---\n\nAre you asking out of curiosity... or does this connect to something you’ve experienced?"
