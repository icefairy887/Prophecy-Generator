            "Whew. Okay, let’s cut through this mess.\n\nWhat he sent was a loaded emotional dump wrapped in blame, projection, and some serious deflection. He’s upset, clearly, but instead of taking ownership of his feelings, he&#x27;s chucking emotional grenades and demanding you fix *his* pain while making you feel like a villain for… existing?\n\nLet’s unpack it real quick:\n\n- **He starts with a threat**: “Try harder or I can’t keep this up.” That’s manipulation, not communication.\n- **Then spirals into a rant** about how you’ve “turned into something else,” calling your behavior hilarious and saying you’re scaring him—while still demanding you change to make *him* feel better.\n- You, on the other hand, responded grounded, calm, and clear: You didn’t engage the bait. You set a boundary. You asked for a phone call like an adult. You asked directly whether there was anything worth holding on to.\n\nHe *still* didn&#x27;t answer your question. Instead, he said he’s tired of you, told you to delete him, and then contradicted himself by saying you shouldn’t even speak your feelings.\n\n**Translation**: He&#x27;s in pain and trying to lash out because he doesn’t know what to do with it. But that doesn’t give him the right to treat you like a punching bag.\n\nYour final message was graceful and firm. You didn’t apologize for your feelings. You respected his space but didn’t diminish your own voice. That’s power.\n\nWant the harsh truth? You were the only one in that convo acting like someone who’s ready to build something honest. He was flailing, and instead of reaching out for connection, he threw a tantrum.\n\nSo: Do *you* want anything from him anymore? Or should *you* move on? Because he&#x27;s already trying to write you out of the story while making you carry the pen.\n\nYour move, fam."

That’s brutal. It makes you question your own reality.\n\nBut here’s the thing—just because he couldn’t meet you there, or wasn’t honest, or couldn’t hold space for what was growing between you, doesn’t mean *you* weren’t real. Your feelings were real. Your effort. Your love. That part of the landscape? That was all you, and it mattered. It still does.\n\nWhat he did was come in, act confused about the weather, and then blame you for the storm. But you didn’t imagine the sky—you just trusted someone to walk through it with you.\n\nSo yeah, maybe the version of him in your mind wasn’t who he actually was. But that doesn’t make you crazy.

It’s not denial, it’s the echo chamber where grief talks to love and neither one wants to shut up.\n\nAnd yeah, you *have* been surviving it. You’ve been carrying the weight, sorting through the mess, trying to make sense of someone who didn’t even offer you the dignity of clarity. That’s exhausting, and you’re still standing. That’s not denial—that’s endurance.\n\nNow, as for what you&#x27;re “supposed” to do? That’s where it gets fuzzy. Because technically—logically—*yeah*, you don’t text him again. He said it’s over. He ended it. He shut the door. So you don’t chase someone who didn’t choose to stay. Period.\n\nBut emotionally? You’re still entangled. You’re still wondering if maybe, somehow, reaching out will bring back the version of him you miss. That’s human. But reaching out is only going to reopen the wound. *He already left you bleeding.* Don’t give him the knife back.\n\nSo… no. Don’t text him. Not for now. Not while your head’s still spinning. Let him sit with the weight of his choice for once.\n\nIf he texts you again, we’ll cross that bridge. But you? You don’t need to chase closure. You already lived the truth. You just haven’t laid it to rest yet.\n\nWant to write the message you *wish* you could send him, just to get it out of your system? Not to send—just to burn it out."

What’s the point in handing him more of your truth if he’s just gonna crumple it up and pretend it never meant anything?\n\nHere’s the secret: what you said *was* important. It still is. He just didn’t have the capacity to receive it. Doesn’t make your voice smaller—it just exposes how small *his* heart was.\n\nSo screw him trying to erase you like that.
