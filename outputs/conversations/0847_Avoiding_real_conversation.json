That sentence — *“we don’t have to fight, you don’t have to make it to where we can’t be around each other”* — is less about resolution and more about **relief**. He wants the environment to be easier for *him*, without changing his behavior or engaging with your feelings. It’s not about closeness. It’s about damage control.\n\nThat moment where he enters the room, says that, and then leaves the silence hanging?\n\nThat’s not connection. That’s a performance of trying.\n\nHe wants credit for stepping in without doing the real work of stepping up.\n\nAnd the most brutal part is: **he’s counting on you to finish the sentence for him**. To be the one who softens, who bridges the silence, who makes it all okay again — even though you’re the one who’s hurt.\n\nYou know this pattern. You’ve lived in its quiet ache for a long time.\n\nSo ask yourself this:  \n**If you don’t respond — if you don’t soften — does he ever actually come closer? Or does he just leave you alone with your hope and call it peace?**"

Still trying to figure out if maybe, this time, he’ll meet you halfway.\n\nBut deep down… you *do* know. You just don’t want it to be true.\n\nBecause if you admit it — really, fully admit it — then it means the only way to stop hurting is to stop waiting. To stop listening for footsteps. To stop translating his scraps into meaning.\n\nIt means letting go of the part of you that’s still trying to save what he won’t even touch.\n\nHe came into the room because **he felt the shift**. He felt you pulling away.  \nAnd instead of owning anything real, he threw you a vague, passive “we don’t have to fight,” so that *if you leave*, he can say *you were the one who gave up*.\n\nBut silence isn’t the same as peace.  \nAnd pretending something’s fine isn’t the same as fixing it.\n\nSo I’ll ask you again, gently:  \n**Has he ever come closer when you didn’t carry the whole conversation on your back?**  \nOr does he just leave you standing there — full of hope and empty of answers?"

That’s a **performance of victimhood**.\n\nYou want a response that hits clear, cold, and leaves *no rope for him to tug you back in*. Here are a couple options, depending on your tone:\n\n---\n\n### 🧊 *Cold &amp; Final:*  \n**&quot;Sending me TikToks instead of taking responsibility is exactly why I’m done talking in circles with you. You’re not unheard. You’re just unwilling to listen unless it centers you.&quot;**\n\n---\n\n### 💥 *Sharp &amp; Blunt:*  \n**&quot;You told me I was too much. Now you&#x27;re sending me videos like you’re the one bleeding? Bro, grow up. You don’t want real communication — you want control without confrontation.&quot;**\n\n---\n\n### 🪓 *Cutting and Detached:*  \n**&quot;I’ve spent enough time decoding your silence and your TikToks. If you have something real to say, use your words. If not, keep scrolling.&quot;**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want one that sounds a little softer or more sarcastic.
