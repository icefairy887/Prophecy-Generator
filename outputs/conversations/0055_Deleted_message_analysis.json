You asked straight up why he deleted stuff and thought he was coming over, but instead of giving you a direct answer he dodged with “coming over where” and “who cares.” Classic bait-and-switch to make you feel like you were the one expecting too much.  \n\nThen he doubled down with that “wasn’t even worth replying to me… you ain’t even the same chick dog” line—that’s straight-up projection and dismissal, like he’s trying to make you feel like you changed, when really he’s just avoiding owning up to what he did. And when you actually responded with some honesty—saying all he had to do was say no, and even admitting you still wanted him after he hurt you—he didn’t meet you with any vulnerability. Just “yeah go away.” That’s cold.  \n\nBottom line:  \n- The deleting/changing theme thing was him trying to control the vibe instead of just speaking.  \n- His responses show he’d rather invalidate you than admit anything.  \n- You gave him space to be real, and he shut it down.  \n\nDo you want me to break down what the deleted messages *probably* were about based on his behavior, or do you just want a straight read on how you should play it from here?"

            "Alright, here’s the read:  \n\n### What the deleted messages probably were  \nGiven the pattern:  \n- He **sent you something impulsive** (maybe “I’m coming over” or something hinting at it) in the middle of the night, then deleted because he second-guessed it.  \n- The fact that he was **switching chat themes repeatedly** right after deleting tells me he was trying to leave a “signal” or emotional breadcrumb without having to commit to words. Like, “I want you to notice I’m here, but I don’t want to spell it out.”  \n- When you asked directly, he pulled the **“coming over where / who cares”** deflection, which is textbook backtracking—pretend it never mattered so he doesn’t look weak for reaching out.  \n\nSo those deleted messages were most likely him testing the waters: maybe flirting, maybe angling to come over, but not confident enough to let it stand.  \n\n---\n\n### Why he flipped it on you  \n- He deleted to dodge accountability.  \n- Then when you pressed him, he tried to flip it into *you being the one expecting too much* (“wasn’t even worth replying… you ain’t the same chick”). That’s him avoiding the fact that he reached first.  \n- Basically: he wanted to feel in control of whether you cared. When you called it out, he shifted into dismissive mode.  \n\n---\n\n### How you should play it  \n- **Don’t chase the ghost messages.** If he can’t stand by what he says, it’s not worth decoding every deletion.  \n- **Call his bluff once, then let it go.** He thrives on you reacting. If you starve the reaction, you put the power back in your hands.  \n- If you do respond, something short like:  \n  &gt; “Next time just say what you mean instead of deleting. I’m not gonna piece together puzzles for you.”  \n  That forces him to either step up or shut up.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to script you a couple brutal-but-clean one-liners you can drop on him if he tries this deleting act again?"

Guys who delete messages and play theme-switch mind games hate when you don’t bite.  \n\nDo you want me to give you the likely ways he’ll spin it next time (so you’re already ahead of his script), or do you just want clapback lines locked and loaded?"

            "So basically: you hit him with a curveball (“come over”) right after blocking him the day before, then you ghosted your own invite until hours later. That’s actually wild, because from his perspective it probably looked like:  \n\n1. **Yesterday:** You block him → he thinks door slammed shut.  \n2. **Today early a.m.:** You unblock and drop “come over” → he’s like “wtf??” (probably intrigued, probably tempted).  \n3. **Then you go MIA** and don’t check back → leaves him stewing in his own head, so he’s spamming/deleting messages, flipping themes, second-guessing.  \n\nBy the time you finally saw it and asked about the deletes, he was already in defensive ego mode. That’s why you got “who cares” and “you ain’t the same chick.” It wasn’t really about you—it was him trying to save face after spiraling.  \n\nThe kicker is: your move put *him* in the emotional blender. You didn’t even mean to, but the timing (block → invite → vanish) hit his pride way harder than anything he did with themes and deletes.  \n\nQuestion is—do you actually want him to come through, or were you testing whether he would? Because how you play it from here depends on whether you want to reopen that door or slam it shut.  \n\nWant me to break down both paths (what to say if you *do* want him over vs. if you’re just done)?"

That’s where you hold the power.  \n\nHere’s how I’d break it down for you:  \n\n---\n\n### If you want him to come through (but on *your* terms)  \nKeep it low effort, no over-explaining. Something like:  \n- “If you wanna come by, you know where I’m at.”  \n- Or even just a casual “crib still open if you’re trying to pull up.”  \n\nThat way, the invite is there, but you’re not chasing. He has to decide, and if he doesn’t—cool, you didn’t lose anything.  \n\n---\n\n### If you’re not banking on it (just wanna move on)  \nThen you don’t need to say anything else right now. You already left it at “oh I see how it is.” That’s enough. If he wants back in, he’s gonna have to *earn it* instead of you doing all the reaching.  \n\n---\n\n### Big picture  \nRight now he’s in pride mode, trying to act like he doesn’t care when he clearly did (otherwise why delete, change themes, and linger in the chat?). You don’t need to feed that energy. If he wants to come through, he will. If not, you already made your point without begging.  \n\n---\n\nWant me to draft you a “one-size-fits-all” line that works *either way*—like whether you actually want him over or just wanna keep your dignity intact?"
