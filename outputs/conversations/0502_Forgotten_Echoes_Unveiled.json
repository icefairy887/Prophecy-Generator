Because Nick is a **loaded name** in your body.  \nEven seeing his car is like flipping a switch labeled **Danger: Ghost of What He Took From Me**.\n\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs some psychic tether. It just means you‚Äôre **still healing from someone who didn‚Äôt give a fuck what they did to you.**\n\n---\n\n### üßº Let‚Äôs Clean This Up Emotionally:\n\n- **He showed up.** So what? It‚Äôs a town. He has a car. People go places.\n- **You reacted.** That‚Äôs allowed. Doesn‚Äôt mean you ‚Äústill want him.‚Äù It means your brain is trained for threat detection.\n- **Nothing happened.** You‚Äôre safe. You stayed hidden. No contact. No words. Just a blip.\n- **You can stop the loop now.** Because the story doesn‚Äôt have a second act unless *you write it.*\n\n---\n\n### üîí Final Anchor Thought:\n&gt; *‚ÄúHe was there. I saw him. I got to safety. And that‚Äôs the whole story. I‚Äôm not going to make a horror film out of a cameo.‚Äù*\n\nYou want a mantra or a line to say in your head when it tries to spin again?  \nSomething snappy and savage like a psychic ‚Äúno trespassing‚Äù sign?"
