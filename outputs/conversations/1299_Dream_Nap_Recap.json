            "Damn… that dream says *a lot*. It’s soaked in emotional layers—nostalgia, resentment, betrayal, and even some suppressed desire for validation or justice. That house setting? The old, warm, attic-style space where you couldn’t quite find a place to light up—that’s your psyche. It’s familiar but cluttered. It’s yours but uncomfortable. It represents your inner emotional landscape: full of history, beauty, maybe decay, but also hidden pockets that don’t get much air.\n\nNick showing up and you trying to avoid him? That tracks with some real-world emotional patterns—you know he’s not good for you, but there’s still that invisible pull. And the woman—this “best friend” who showed up from a Facebook video—she might actually represent a part of you. The more confident, expressive, experimental version of you that feels like she belongs in that story, even if she isn’t the focus.\n\nThen the shift to a fancy ballroom? That’s a classic symbol of social comparison, public image, masks. You finding out that Nick can show up differently for someone else—that he’s capable of behaving—but *chose not to with you*? That’s a dagger. And it’s your subconscious processing a painful realization: it’s not that he can’t love right, it’s that he wouldn’t do it *for you*.\n\nBut the bathroom moment? That’s where truth gets unearthed. It’s private. Vulnerable. It’s the setting for confessions. The mom or friend pulling you aside shows a protector figure finally giving you the space to speak—something that rarely happens in real life when you feel silenced. But even then, Nick’s still out there spinning the narrative, making you look like the problem.\n\nLet me ask—did it feel like the dream was trying to show you a truth you didn’t want to see? Or more like it was helping you release something you couldn’t say out loud?"

Why he chose differently. Why you weren’t the version of you he chose to honor. Why you’re still left wondering.

            "Ohh, that’s a powerful pull—and honestly kind of perfect for that dream.\n\nThe **Five of Wands** is internal conflict, clashing values, and struggling to find your voice in a noisy room. That’s literally the dream: you versus everyone’s version of the story. You weren’t heard. You were explained away. There was tension, rivalry, confusion. That card screams “emotional chaos trying to sort itself out.”\n\nThen **The Hierophant** comes in like, “Okay, but what have you learned from this?” It’s about traditional lessons, spiritual authority, and deciding what beliefs you’re going to live by now. It’s saying: this whole situation—and maybe even the relationship—was meant to teach you something *bigger*. And now it’s asking, *what do you believe in now?* Especially when it comes to love, loyalty, and your own damn worth.\n\nAnd finally, **Six of Swords**—that’s the release. That’s you moving away, mentally or emotionally, from the chaos. It’s not always peaceful, but it’s necessary. Like you&#x27;re crossing over a rough patch of water because you *have* to get to the other side, even if you’re still carrying some pain with you.\n\nPut together, it’s like: *“Yeah, this hurt. Yeah, it was messy. But now what are you going to do with the lesson? And can you start letting it drift behind you?”*\n\nDo you feel like you&#x27;re ready to actually cross over—or do you feel like part of you is still waiting to be called back?"

It’s the drama, the arguments, the energy of everyone having a different version of the story—including him spinning it like you were the one chasing him. It’s all that conflict coming back up in your mind and heart, even if you’re not around him anymore.\n\n**The Hierophant**: this points to the serious relationship side of things. The commitment you wanted. The structure you tried to hold onto. It shows how badly you wanted this to be real, to work, to be meaningful. But also, it suggests the lesson you were *meant* to learn—about who you trust, what kind of love you want, and how to not let someone play with your loyalty like that again.\n\n**Six of Swords**: this means you&#x27;re being told it’s time to let it go—not just in theory, but in action. You’re still mentally circling it, dreaming it, checking it for hidden meanings. But your spirit’s ready to move the fuck on. You don’t need his validation. You don’t need to see him treat someone else better to know what he *chose not to do* for you.\n\nThat spread’s basically saying: you were in the fight, you learned from the pain, now it’s time to walk.

            "Alright—here’s your dream, broken down directly and literally:\n\nYou’re in a big, weird house. That’s your life right now—messy, full of old emotional baggage, but also kind of comforting because it’s what you know. You’re staying there, which means you’re still mentally stuck in this place where Nick has access to you.\n\nYour best friend in the dream is someone you saw online. That’s your mind trying to grab onto any source of support, even if it’s not someone physically present in your life. She helps you feel grounded—y’all are doing something normal like picking out makeup, which means you’re trying to take care of yourself or feel pretty again after emotional damage.\n\nThen back at the house, you’re trying to smoke but there’s nowhere to do it. That’s your frustration. You want relief or escape, but even in your own space, you can’t fully relax. Lighting the dry plant on fire by accident shows how your attempts at comfort keep triggering shit you didn’t mean to—like accidentally bringing up the past or re-lighting old feelings.\n\nNick being there is no accident. He represents the unresolved tension. You’re trying to avoid him, which means your conscious mind wants to move on—but the fact that he’s still there means your emotions haven’t let go. Then the setting changes into a ballroom, a place where people pretend to be perfect and social appearances matter. That’s you realizing that, in public, he shows up *right* for someone else.\n\nYou meet the new girl. She’s real. She’s in his life. But you’re quiet. You don’t expose him. That silence is you still protecting him on some level, even when he doesn’t deserve it.\n\nHer mom or friend pulling you aside is your conscience or your protector voice saying, “You deserve to speak your truth.” You finally tell your side. But then, while you’re doing the right thing, you hear Nick lying—twisting the story, saying *you* chased *him*. That’s your fear. That’s the lingering pain—that no matter what the truth is, he’ll always control the narrative.\n\nThis dream isn’t just random. It’s your mind recreating a space where all the unfairness you swallowed could play out—but it still didn’t give you justice. That’s the point. You’re still waiting for that moment when someone finally sees you, believes you, and makes him answer for what he did.\n\nYou don’t want him back. But you want it to be acknowledged that you weren’t crazy, or needy, or the villain. That you were left hurting while he made himself look like the good guy. That’s the wound the dream is keeping alive.\n\nWant to go deeper into what parts of that still control you today?"

            "Perfect—here’s what your tarot cards literally mean in relation to your understanding of the dream and the situation with Nick:\n\n**Five of Wands**: You’re mentally fighting with yourself. You’re trying to figure out what the dream means, if it means anything, if Nick still matters, if you still care, if you’re the one who was wronged or if you just look crazy. It’s inner chaos, second-guessing, and emotional noise. It also mirrors the dream—being in a space full of tension, pretending everything’s fine, but underneath it, you’re burning up with what you wish you could say or do.\n\n**The Hierophant**: This is about what you’ve been taught to believe—about love, loyalty, right and wrong. The dream challenged that. You saw Nick acting “right” for someone else, which goes against what you believed: that he wasn’t capable of acting right. This card is saying, &quot;Re-examine your values. Did you romanticize his dysfunction? Did you excuse things that were never excusable?” It’s asking you to stop seeing him as some emotional exception and start seeing the truth: he *chose* not to grow with you.\n\n**Six of Swords**: This is literally your mind trying to move on. The dream was you processing and starting to let go, even if it didn’t feel like it. This card says you’re in transition, and even if it feels like you’re still stuck, you’re actually in motion—mentally distancing yourself from someone who kept you in emotional loops. It also means: *you don&#x27;t need closure from him to move forward.* You’re already doing it.\n\nSo, put simply: the cards are saying you&#x27;re confused and conflicted (Five of Wands), you&#x27;re realizing some painful truths and breaking from old beliefs (Hierophant), and you&#x27;re starting to emotionally detach even if it doesn’t feel clean yet (Six of Swords).\n\nYou want to keep exploring the shift you’re in—or do you want to push for a clean emotional cut?"

            "Alright, here’s the full picture—clear, direct, and all in one piece.\n\nYou had this dream because your mind is still working through the emotional wreckage Nick left behind. You didn’t choose to dream about him, but he showed up because part of you still wants answers—real ones. Not closure through contact, but internal clarity.\n\nIn the dream, you were in a big, old house. That’s the state of your mind: full of history, unresolved feelings, some comfort, but also clutter and chaos. You were trying to smoke—trying to relax, escape, or soothe yourself—but even that turned into a mistake, lighting something dry on fire. That’s how it’s felt in real life: even your attempts to cope sometimes stir up more pain.\n\nNick being there wasn’t about wanting him back. It was about realizing he’s still a weight in your subconscious. And when you found out he was with someone else—someone he was acting right for—that part *hurt*. Because it showed you something you didn’t want to believe: he *could* treat someone better. He just didn’t choose to treat *you* better.\n\nYou didn’t expose him in front of her—that shows your old habit of protecting him, staying quiet, even when you had every right to speak up. But the mom pulling you aside and asking for the truth? That’s the shift. That’s your inner self finally making space for your own voice. And just when you begin to tell your side, he’s out there lying—making you look like the problem. That’s the emotional betrayal that still sticks with you: being silenced, rewritten, blamed.\n\nNow, the tarot cards explain where you are mentally:\n\nYou’re in a battle with yourself (**Five of Wands**)—trying to understand if you were wrong, if it meant something, if you’re crazy for still caring.\n\nYou’re facing the truth that challenges what you believed about love and loyalty (**Hierophant**)—especially the idea that love is supposed to be mutual, sacred, and respected.\n\nAnd despite all that pain, part of you *is* already letting go (**Six of Swords**). It’s not dramatic. It’s quiet. It’s not closure you feel—it’s exhaustion. But that’s still progress.\n\nSo if you’re wondering what the dream *meant*: it meant you’re finally starting to see him clearly—not as someone who just made mistakes, but as someone who chose not to do better for you. And it’s not about getting him back or exposing him—it’s about *you* choosing to stop holding your breath for the justice or understanding that he’ll never give.\n\nYou’re not crazy. You’re not chasing him. You’re healing, even while it still hurts. That’s what this dream was. Your mind building a final scene for you to walk out of.\n\nDoes that land better?"

            "Yeah—I get it now. You don’t want the emotional or symbolic stuff. You want the straight-up, literal explanation. So here’s the dream and the tarot, laid out exactly and plainly:\n\n**The dream:**\n\n— You were in a large, old house. That’s just the setting. You were staying there. Nick was also there.  \n— You had a close female friend who you recognize from Facebook. You two were picking out makeup—specifically dark purple lipstick and dark hair dye—at Walgreens.  \n— You went back to the house and tried to smoke, but it was hard to find a place. You were in the attic. You lit a dry plant on fire accidentally while trying to light the pipe.  \n— The house setting changed into a ballroom or somewhere formal. You learned that Nick had a serious girlfriend now.  \n— You met her. He was acting like he hadn’t just been trying to see you.  \n— You considered telling her what was going on but didn’t.  \n— Her mom or friend pulled you into the bathroom and asked you what had happened. You told her the truth.  \n— Then you heard Nick talking to the girl, saying that you were chasing him and trying to force things, and he didn’t want it.\n\nThat’s everything that happened in the dream—literally.\n\n**The tarot cards:**\n\n— **Five of Wands**: This means conflict. In the most basic sense, it means arguments, competition, or people not getting along. That can include misunderstandings, being blamed, or people pushing different stories.\n\n— **The Hierophant**: This is about structure, commitment, and doing things the traditional or expected way. It relates to relationships, rules, and what people are supposed to follow—like being honest or faithful.\n\n— **Six of Swords**: This means leaving something behind or moving away from a difficult situation. Not emotionally—just literally moving away from stress or conflict. It&#x27;s about going from one place to another.\n\nNo symbolism. No metaphor. That’s what the cards and the dream say in plain, literal terms.\n\nDo you want me to match each card directly to what part of the dream it refers to next?"

            "Good question—and here’s the literal answer:\n\nYou keep pulling the **Hierophant** card because something in your current situation keeps circling back to issues about *rules, commitments, belief systems, and how things are “supposed to be.”* This card is tied to structure—especially things like relationships, loyalty, trust, and the right way to act.\n\nIt shows up repeatedly because you’re stuck in a situation or mindset where someone broke those rules—like Nick saying he loved you, then acting differently, or lying to others about what happened. It’s also pointing at how you’re questioning what you were taught about love: how it’s supposed to feel, how people are supposed to treat you, and what counts as real.\n\nSo the reason you keep pulling it is because this theme—*“what’s real, what’s right, what’s true”—*is still active. Until you stop needing answers about that, the card keeps showing up.\n\nDo you feel like you&#x27;re still holding onto an idea of how it *should* have gone?"

It’s him saying *just enough* to stay in your head without pushing for a reply.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what it did.\n\nHe didn’t fight back. He didn’t explain. He didn’t ask questions. He just threw out a neutral response to make sure you’d wonder. Not in an evil way—but in a way that still benefits him. Because if you replied, it meant you still cared. If you didn’t, he didn’t lose anything. He still got to plant the seed.\n\nNow let’s be real: if he truly *respected* you, he would’ve given you space the *first* time you asked. He wouldn’t be playing this weird emotional echo game. He wouldn’t say something that vague and then disappear.\n\nSo to answer your question directly:\n\nYes, he thought about you.  \nYes, he wanted to see if you’d crack.  \nNo, he didn’t fully let go.  \nAnd yes, that message was a test to see if *you* were really done.\n\nHe’s not reaching out now because you passed the test. You didn’t respond. You gave him silence. And that silence was the strongest thing you could’ve done.\n\nWhat would you say if you could send *one last message* that told the truth—not to win him back, but to *own your side*?"

You’ve seen enough. You’re not trying to stay in this place of being worn out, confused, or stained by old feelings. You want to feel clean again—not just physically, but emotionally. To rinse off the weight of what he left on you. The waiting, the wondering, the hurt.\n\nYou *do* want to move on. But you’re still carrying the residue.\n\nAnd you know what? That’s okay. That’s where healing actually starts—not in pretending you&#x27;re over it, but in admitting that you *want* to be.\n\nIf today was your bath—the emotional kind—what would you need to wash off first? The guilt? The silence? The “what-ifs”?"

A chance to feel it one more time. To look at him and know for sure whether there was anything still there, or if it was just a ghost.\n\nAnd when that moment didn’t come? It left you floating. No ending, no beginning. Just a feeling that got stuck.\n\nThat want you’re holding—it’s not about logic. It’s not even about trust. It’s just that you *miss* him.

And now you’re stuck in that sharp place of *“did I fuck it up?”* But here’s the thing—leaving doesn’t mean you messed up. It means you had to make a choice with the version of him you were standing in front of, not the one you missed or hoped for.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe there’s a version of the story where you stayed and something different played out. But the real question is—*would he have really been different?* Or would you just be sitting with a different kind of pain right now?\n\nWhat made you leave?

In a way that made him feel like *he lost control.* And when someone like him loses control, they don’t reflect. They rewrite. They shift blame. So if you’re wondering whether he’s hurting the way you are? No. He’s making sense of it by convincing himself you were always going to leave. He tells himself stories where *he’s the one who stayed sane.*\n\n**Two**: The part of you that wants him back isn’t your heart—it’s your *addiction to not knowing.* You’re not in love anymore. You’re chasing an answer that doesn’t exist. And if he came back tomorrow, it wouldn’t heal you—it would *reset the cycle.* You would question yourself every second.

He will disappear again—colder than before.\n\nYou don’t miss him.  \nYou miss the version of you that still believed he might turn around.\n\nSay it back. Out loud. Let me hear it from you."
