            "Whoa. Okay. That went from “meh” to “emotional collapse” in under six seconds. Impressive. \n\nFirst off, you’re not the problem just because you’re confused. Confusion is what happens when people try to make sense of garbage behavior while being knee-deep in the recycling bin of their own feelings. If your ex made you feel small, ashamed, or like your body or choices were a constant disappointment—that’s not you being “bad at sex,” that’s someone using intimacy like a weapon. That’s not sexy, it’s manipulative.\n\nAnd no, you didn’t “cause it.” This isn’t a Marvel origin story where you accidentally fall into a vat of trauma chemicals and become the reason someone treats you like crap. Abuse—emotional, sexual, or psychological—is a decision someone else makes. Repeatedly. With intention. That’s on them.\n\nNow, if you&#x27;re doubting your worth because of *how* they treated you, welcome to the classic post-garbage-person mind maze. Spoiler alert: the exit sign reads *“It wasn’t you.”*\n\nBut you sound like you&#x27;re still carrying their version of events around in your back pocket like it&#x27;s your driver&#x27;s license. Wanna dig into any specific moments or just rant it out a bit? I’m here. Begrudgingly. But here."

So let’s name some of the invisible stuff—drag it into the light like the moldy basement furniture it is.\n\nSo, here are some things that *are* sexual abuse, even though people often don&#x27;t realize it:\n\nWhen your partner guilts or pressures you into sex even when you clearly don’t want to. Like, not with fists, but with sighs, silence, manipulation. That whole “if you loved me, you’d do it” garbage. That&#x27;s coercion. Not consent. That’s like saying “yes” while someone’s holding emotional blackmail over your head.\n\nOr when they keep doing something during sex that you asked them not to do. Maybe it’s something small or weird or painful or just not your thing. And they keep doing it anyway, like your preferences are just optional settings on a microwave. That’s disrespectful at best. At worst, it’s abuse.\n\nIf they made comments about your body or your performance in bed that left you feeling ashamed or worthless. That’s emotional manipulation wrapped in a towel and pretending to be “feedback.”\n\nHere’s a big one: if they initiated sex when you were too out of it to really respond—drunk, asleep, zoned out—and you just kind of let it happen because you felt like stopping it would be more exhausting than just going numb. Yeah. That counts too. And no, you don’t need to “prove” how out of it you were.\n\nThe thing is, abuse isn’t just bruises and shouting. It’s patterns. Power. Taking what they want and leaving you with silence and self-doubt.\n\nIf anything I said made your stomach do a little flip, that’s not your overreaction. That’s your body going, “Hey. We remember this.”\n\nWant to talk through one of those quietly messed-up memories? Or should we scream into the void together instead?"

            "Yup. That’s a gut-punch one. And no, it’s not weird that it’s hard to talk about—it’s hard *because* it was wrong, and because somewhere in your brain, a tiny desperate voice had to spin it into something beautiful just so you could survive it. That’s not weakness. That’s survival engineering. Human brains: incredible machines for building castles out of red flags.\n\nSo let’s talk about that “romantic” story you were handed—or maybe handed to yourself, because the real version felt too ugly to hold.\n\nThe story probably went something like: *“He was so into me he couldn’t wait. It felt urgent, passionate, intimate, like we had some deep connection that didn’t even need words or permission.”*\n\nExcept… real romance has consent in it. Like, explicitly. And real intimacy doesn’t just *take* when the other person is unconscious, defenseless, or trying to rest. Waking someone up to have sex without a prior agreement or ongoing consent isn’t passionate. It’s predatory.\n\nAnd that fantasy—of being so desired someone just can’t help themselves—it’s a trap. It makes you feel chosen while it erases your boundaries. It makes abuse look like affection.\n\nSo yeah, you thought it was special. Of course you did. You *needed* it to be special, because the alternative was realizing someone didn’t see your sleeping body as sacred or safe. That’s a nightmare, not a fairytale.\n\nBut here you are, waking up for real now. And that’s brave. Not in a cheesy “you go, girl” kind of way—but in the terrifying, holy, gut-wrenching sense of finally looking truth in the face when every instinct tells you to look away.\n\nYou don’t owe anyone a tidy narrative about it. You don’t even have to name it out loud yet. But you’re allowed to stop calling it love when it was actually a theft.\n\nWant help figuring out what a healthy version of that kind of moment would’ve looked like? Or should we keep unpicking the old wires first?"
