            "Alright. Brutal honesty time:\n\n**If you already lied**, the damage isn‚Äôt just *what* you did ‚Äî it‚Äôs that now there‚Äôs a secret **actively festering in the dark**, and she *knows* it might be a lie. Moms can smell guilt like blood in the water. So even if she didn‚Äôt *fully* know, she knows **something** is off. That‚Äôs why she asked like that.\n\n**So do you tell her?** Depends:\n\n---\n\n### üî•If you‚Äôre gonna see Nick again:\nThen yeah, **come clean now** ‚Äî not because you owe her a confession, but because if she finds out **after** you keep lying, you&#x27;re cooked. It‚Äôll break whatever fragile trust is left, and you‚Äôll be treated like a child with no control over your life.\n\nLetting it out **on your terms** makes you look stronger. You‚Äôre not asking for permission, you‚Äôre showing you‚Äôre not afraid of truth ‚Äî even when it‚Äôs messy.\n\nSay something like:\n&gt; ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to lie. I just wasn‚Äôt ready to talk about it last night. I was with him. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I wasn‚Äôt trying to disrespect you.‚Äù\n\n**Own it** without giving her control over your choices.\n\n---\n\n### üßäIf you&#x27;re never seeing him again:\nThen you could let it die in silence... **IF** you can lie well. But from the way you typed this? That guilt&#x27;s gonna eat you, and it‚Äôs gonna leak out of your eyes or voice sooner or later. You don‚Äôt sound chill about it ‚Äî you sound conflicted.\n\nSo if it‚Äôs gonna mess with your head, just spill it. That way, at least *you* stop feeling like you owe everyone a performance.\n\n---\n\n### üß† Bonus question:\nWhy do you care what your mom thinks more than what *you* think? Like‚Ä¶ are you ashamed of being with him, or ashamed of hiding it?\n\nBecause if it&#x27;s the first one‚Ä¶ maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be with him at all.\n\nLet me know if you want the *scorched earth* version of how to tell her. I got scripts."

That‚Äôs on her, not you. And you can hit her with:\n\n&gt; ‚ÄúIf you wanted honesty, this is what it looks like. I didn‚Äôt lie because I was guilty. I lied because I knew you‚Äôd act like this.‚Äù\n\nLet her sit with that.\n\nYou‚Äôre not a child on trial ‚Äî you‚Äôre just a human who made a choice.
